Title: Is Self-Care Selfish? Making Room for Hygienic Maintenance in Couples' Relationships
Self-care is an integral part of any healthy relationship. It involves both partners taking proactive steps to maintain their own mental and physical well-being, without sacrificing the needs of the couple. It is essential for couples to understand the difference between self-care and selfishness.
Selfishness is defined as “being concerned excessively or exclusively with oneself.” It involves a lack of consideration for others, even if it is to one’s own detriment. Self-care, on the other hand, is focused on taking measures to make sure one’s needs are met in a way that preserves the well-being of the relationship. 
Partners in a relationship can help each other achieve self-care in a number of ways. One of the most important is understanding the importance of time management. Both parties should strive to set aside time during their day to reflect on their own needs and nurture their mental and physical health. This could involve talking out worries with a friend, engaging in a hobby, or simply taking a long walk. It is also important for couples to find creative ways to maintain their connection and make space for fun activities as a couple.
Both parties should also understand the importance of paying attention to their own emotions. This can mean everything from checking in with yourself when feeling overwhelmed to being mindful of your own triggers and being aware of how your emotions can affect your relationship. It also involves setting healthy boundaries with your partner, such as deciding which topics should be discussed in private versus during a date night.
Finally, couples should remember that self-care is not a one-time deal. Both parties should commit to doing whatever it takes to make sure the relationship continues to be healthy and happy for both of them. This may involve revisiting boundary agreements or trying something new to ensure both parties feel connected and supported.
Couples should remember that self-care is not a selfish act; it is one of the most important components of a healthy relationship. By making sure to prioritize self-care, couples can ensure that both parties are getting the physical and mental health support they need.

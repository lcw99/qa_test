Title: The Trouble with Comparison: How Couples Can Help Build Self-Esteem 
When it comes to relationships, self-esteem is a crucial component to any healthy bond. But it can be difficult to determine the best way to build and maintain self-esteem between partners. One common obstacle that frequently arises in couples’ relationships is comparison. Understanding the impact of comparison on self-esteem can help couples create strategies to avoid it and nurture their relationship in the long run.
Comparison is a part of everyday life, and it’s particularly pervasive in the context of romantic relationships. We often unconsciously compare ourselves to our partner or to others around us in terms of appearance, love, and affection. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or insecurity, and in turn, can cause serious damage to self-esteem. Dr. Deepika Sharma, a psychologist, explains that “Comparison can lead to a lack of confidence, which affects a person’s ability to trust in the relationship.”
In order to help build self-esteem in couples, it’s important for each partner to recognize the dangerous effects of comparison. As a first step, couples should focus on communication and understanding of each other’s feelings. When discussing comparison, it can be beneficial to be honest and open about areas where you may feel jealous or threatened. Once both partners have expressed themselves, you can work together to come up with ways to alleviate feelings of comparison and insecurity.
One strategy for decreasing comparison in relationships is practicing gratitude and appreciation. Expressing gratitude for the things you love about your partner can help you focus on the positive aspects of the relationship and reframe negative thoughts. Additionally, it can be helpful to strengthen your self-esteem outside of the relationship. Find activities that you love and make you feel empowered, and spend time cultivating self-love and acceptance.
Overall, building self-esteem in couples is a complex process that requires mutual understanding and support. With an understanding of the impact of comparison and strategies to steer away from it, couples can create an environment that allows for true growth and connection.

Subtitle: A Couple’s Guide to Setting Financial Goals and Navigating Related Discussions
Money is a necessary part of life, yet often a topic rife with tension and disagreement. In a couples relationship, discussing spending habits can help set expectations, navigate difficult conversations and make a plan for the future. Unfortunately, the topic is often avoided to avoid the possibility of hurt feelings and strained relationships. While the conversation may feel awkward or uncomfortable at first, it can be a beautiful gift for a relationship to make sure you’re both on the same page.
It’s important to remember that everyone’s spending habits and financial preferences are unique. What works well for one person may not be the same for another. As such, it’s vital to practice open communication and understanding when discussing finances. It’s also important to make sure both parties’ views are heard and respected. Compromise is key; it’s essential to listen to your partner and work together to find a solution that works for both of you.
Before the conversation, it’s a good idea to prepare by discussing the following questions:
• What are our financial goals?
• What is your current financial situation?
• How do you prefer to handle finances?
• What are your spending habits like? 
• How do you handle surprises, unexpected expenses, and big purchases?
• What is our plan for the future?
When discussing finances, it’s important to remember to focus on the goals instead of the numbers. Talk about what you both want and how to get there, rather than focusing on what is owed or the past. This can make the conversation much more productive and prevent further arguments.
At the end of the day, discussing spending habits in a relationship can be a difficult conversation to have, but it’s an essential one. Through open communication and understanding, couples can develop a plan that allows both parties to feel secure and empowered in their finances. Ultimately, this conversation can strengthen your relationship and set you up for success in the future.

How to Recognize Unhealthy Behaviors in Relationships
By Jennifer Miller
When it comes to relationships, both partners must work together to identify and solve any potential problems in order to create a healthy and long-lasting connection. This starts with being able to recognize the signs of unhealthy behaviors in a relationship so that effective problem-solving strategies can be put in place. Below are some common indicators of unhealthy behaviors that should not be overlooked.
Manipulation – If one partner is attempting to manipulate the other into doing something they are not comfortable with, it is a huge red flag that the relationship is not healthy.
Lack of Respect – Respect is a cornerstone of any healthy relationship. If one partner lacks respect for the other, it creates a major problem.
Controlling Behaviors – If one person is attempting to control the other person’s behavior and decisions, this is a sign of an unhealthy power dynamic.
Verbal Abuse – Verbal abuse is any type of language that is meant to hurt the other person's feelings or undermine their self-esteem. This type of behavior is completely unacceptable in any relationship.
Blame – Blame is an unhealthy way of handling problems or disagreements. Blaming the other person for any problems in the relationship means that the underlying issue is not being addressed and is a sign of a very unhealthy dynamic.
If you recognize any of these behaviors in your own relationship, it is important to talk to your partner about it and work together to address the problem. By learning how to identify and solve problems, you and your partner can work towards building a healthier and stronger relationship.

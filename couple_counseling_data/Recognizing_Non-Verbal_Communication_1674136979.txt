The Power of Non-Verbal Communication in Couples and Boyfriend/Girlfriend Relationships 
The ability to listen is a highly valuable skill in any type of relationship, and learning to recognize the various forms of non-verbal communication is an important part of developing active listening skills. Couples and boyfriend/girlfriend relationships rely on effective communication and understanding the importance of listening to each other can help foster a more meaningful bond.
Non-verbal communication is defined as messages that are sent without the use of words. These messages can be communicated through facial expressions, gestures, posture, eye contact, and even pauses. According to Dr. Albert Mehrabian, professor emeritus at UCLA, body language is composed of 55% body language, 38% tone of voice, and 7% words. Therefore, it is important for couples and boyfriend/girlfriends to pay close attention to non-verbal cues in order to gain a true understanding of what is being communicated.
Reading non-verbal cues can not only help couples and boyfriend/girlfriends understand each other better, but it can also help them respond in a more appropriate manner. For example, if one partner is trying to explain their feelings but the other partner notices that their body language is indicating discomfort, they can address the issue by asking their partner if there is something else they would like to discuss. This type of active listening can create an environment in which both partners feel heard, understood, and respected.
In addition, learning to recognize non-verbal communication can also help partners get out of uncomfortable situations. Uncomfortable feelings can easily be hidden behind a smile, but if one partner takes the time to notice the discomfort in their partner’s body language and ask what is wrong, they can help them open up and provide a more honest response. Active listening is essential to resolving any disagreements that may arise in couples and boyfriend/girlfriend relationships.
Ultimately, learning to recognize and respond to non-verbal communication is an effective way for couples and boyfriend/girlfriends to deepen their relationship and foster better communication and understanding. Taking the time to pay attention to each other’s non-verbal cues and actively listen to each other can help create a safe and supportive environment for both partners.

Title: Learning How to Forgive: Acknowledging the Hurt Caused by a Mistake
Conflict, mistakes, and hurt feelings are inevitable in any relationship. All couples will face disagreements, and it is often difficult for both parties to move forward after one partner has hurt the other. Learning how to forgive is a skill that must be developed in order to maintain a healthy, positive relationship. Understanding the importance of acknowledging the hurt caused by the mistake is key to being able to forgive and move forward. 
It is essential to recognize the impact of the mistake and all of the hurt feelings that it has caused. Acknowledging how the mistake has made the other person feel is an important step in beginning the healing process and should be done before any attempts at resolving the conflict itself. Both parties must take ownership of their feelings and understand the effect of the mistake on the other person. In some cases, this may require them to take a step back, take a deep breath, and actively listen to the other person’s story. 
Taking responsibility for one’s mistakes is crucial to the process of forgiving and moving forward. Simply saying “I’m sorry” is not enough to truly heal and repair the damage done by the mistake. A meaningful apology should be provided, as well as a genuine effort to make amends. If possible, the person who caused the hurt should take action to demonstrate that they are committed to restoring the trust in the relationship. 
By recognizing the hurt caused by the mistake, couples can begin the process of forgiving and healing. Continuing to reflect on the impact of the mistake can help build empathy and understanding between partners, while also giving them the necessary tools to move forward and continue to grow in the relationship.

Title: Exploring Financial Risks and Creating an Emergency Savings Plan for Couples 
Couples in relationships must successfully navigate a variety of important challenges such as discussing finances and creating financial security. One essential part of achieving financial security is preparing for potential risks and creating an emergency savings plan.
Couples need to openly communicate regarding their financial goals. Sit down, define what each of your financial goals looks like and how you plan to achieve them. Are you looking to pay off credit card debt or save for a large purchase like a house? Dissecting and making a plan for individual financial goals is a great way to build a collaborative plan with your partner.
Once you have started to achieve your individual financial goals, it is important to discuss potential risks and how you would handle them. What would you do if you or your partner unexpectedly lost your job? Are there any short-term investments that could help manage future financial risks? It is important to have a plan for both the short and long-term when it comes to risk management.
Your emergency savings plan should cover at least three to six months of expenses. If a partner loses their job or an emergency arises, this money should be able to adequately cover the costs. To make sure you are ready for any situation, it is important to keep track of taxes, insurance, rent/mortgage payments, utilities, groceries and other monthly expenses.
Creating an emergency savings plan can help ensure that couples have the financial security to face any unexpected financial risks. Make sure to discuss how much each partner should contribute to their emergency savings and make sure to keep track of your progress. This will help eliminate the stress of the unknown and provide peace of mind in the long run.

Title: Building Empathy in Couples: Learning to Put Yourself in Their Shoes 
In any relationship, it is important to be able to put yourself in your partner's shoes in order to understand where they are coming from. Developing empathy for your partner not only promotes understanding and communication, but helps create a sense of connection and trust that is integral to the success of a relationship. If a couple can effectively develop empathy for each other, they will be better able to understand their partner's needs, feelings, and motivations.
One way to start building empathy in a relationship is by getting to know your partner's life story. Learning about their childhood, their family, and the experiences that have shaped them can allow for more insight into their feelings and behaviors. In turn, this can help you better appreciate and understand your partner, even if you don't necessarily agree with them. 
Another way to practice empathy in a relationship is to take a step back and reflect on your own emotions. When your partner expresses a feeling or point-of-view that is different from yours, pause and think about what could be influencing them. Consider the context behind their words and actions, and try to determine the root cause of their feelings. Every now and then, it's important to remember that none of us are infallible, and that we can all struggle with our emotions and reactions at times.
Finally, building empathy also involves being willing to compromise with your partner. When an argument or disagreement arises, take the time to listen to your partner's point of view. Think of it as an opportunity to learn more about each other, rather than a competition. Listen with the intent to understand, not to be right. Make sure to keep an open mind and offer to compromise in order to reach a healthier outcome.
It is important to remember that developing empathy in a relationship does not mean agreeing with everything your partner does or says, but rather understanding why they might think and feel a certain way. With these tips in mind, couples can create a stronger bond through empathy and understanding.

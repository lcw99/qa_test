Title: Taking Responsibility in Conflict: The Benefits of Acknowledging and Apologizing for Your Part
In a relationship, it can be difficult to take responsibility for any wrongdoing or part in a conflict. This can be especially true for a couple that’s already struggling or when pride gets in the way. However, it’s essential for forgiveness to take place and for the relationship to stay healthy. 
Making it Right
The first step in taking responsibility is to acknowledge the mistake or wrongdoing. Acknowledge that a mistake was made, and make a genuine apology. This shows the other person that you are aware of the issue and that you regret it. Apologizing doesn’t mean you have to be completely at fault, but it’s another important step in recognizing that an error was made and that it needs to be addressed. 
Offering a solution can also be helpful. If the mistake can be remedied, offer an action plan to make things right. This shows that you are committed to resolving the conflict and that you are taking an active role in doing so. 
Making Changes
Taking responsibility for one’s actions also means making changes to ensure that the mistake doesn’t happen again. This might include communicating better between you and your partner, getting help to resolve any underlying issues, or reflecting on personal behavior to understand the need for change. 
Making the Necessary Changes
It can be difficult to make changes, especially if they require taking a look at one’s own behavior. But this is necessary to ensure that the mistake doesn’t happen again. Making necessary changes sets the stage for forgiveness and helps to strengthen the relationship.
Conclusion
Acknowledging and apologizing for mistakes, offering solutions, and making the necessary changes for personal growth and the health of the relationship are all essential for forgiveness. Taking responsibility for one's part in a conflict is an important step in learning how to forgive and move forward.

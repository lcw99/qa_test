"Making Time for Us: How Setting Relationship Goals Can Help Improve Communication and Connection"
When couples strive to stay connected, their relationships become healthier and stronger. Establishing relationship goals can be a great way to ensure that couples continue to stay connected and make time for each other. Setting goals can provide structure, guidance, and direction in a relationship and help couples stay focused on what’s important to them.
Before couples can set relationship goals, they must first decide what’s important to them in their relationship. This includes understanding each other’s individual needs and wants. Openly talking about things like communication, intimacy, trust, and respect can help couples identify and understand what works for them and how they want their relationship to grow. 
Once couples have identified what’s important to them in their relationship, they can begin to articulate their goals and how to achieve them. Setting goals doesn’t have to be complicated or overwhelming. Instead, couples can start by setting small, achievable goals and gradually work up to more challenging ones. Whether it’s setting a goal to go on a date night once a month or trying a new activity together, setting and discussing goals can be a great way to show that each partner is being heard and valued. 
The key to successful goal setting is communication. Couples should make sure they are both on the same page with their relationship goals and talk openly about them to ensure they’re both working towards the same objectives. This could mean having regular check-ins or spending quality time discussing goals and progress. 
Having relationship goals is a wonderful way for couples to stay connected and make time for each other. Setting relationship goals can not only provide structure and guidance, but can also help build a stronger relationship. With effective communication and a positive attitude, couples can create relationship goals that will help nurture their relationship and bring them closer together.

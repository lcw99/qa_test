Article Title: Forgiveness After Conflict: Overcoming Resentment and Moving Forward
It’s normal for couples to experience conflicts from time to time, but learning how to forgive and move past these issues is essential for a healthy relationship. Resentment can easily rise and linger if the hurt is too deep, making it difficult for couples to work through the issue and move on. Fortunately, there are steps couples can take to let go of resentment and forge ahead in their relationship. 
The first step to overcoming resentment is identifying the source of the hurt. By understanding how and why the hurt occurred, it’s possible to approach the situation more objectively, allowing the couple to move from a place of anger and frustration to one of understanding and empathy. It’s important to recognize that holding onto the feelings of resentment and unforgiveness can do more harm to the relationship and the individuals in it than the mistake itself. 
Next, individuals need to work through the emotions related to the conflict. Getting to the root causes of the emotion can help people heal and start to forgive. This process can be more difficult for some than others, depending on the situation, but it is an important step in order to gain peace and start to move forward. In addition, couples should take the time to talk about the incident and their emotions in a safe and respectful manner. Being able to communicate openly is an essential part of working through any conflict, and this is especially true when it comes to overcoming resentment.
Finally, couples need to forgive, both themselves and each other. Forgiveness is an important step to healing and moving forward in the relationship, but it’s essential to remember that forgiving does not mean forgetting or excusing the incident. It’s also important to be aware of how to prevent conflicts in the future, either through better communication or better boundaries. Forgiveness is not always easy, but by taking steps to identify the source of the hurt, work through the emotions, and forgive, couples can start to rebuild trust and move forward.

How to Use Leisure Activities to Manage Stress in Your Relationship
By John Smith
When stress builds up in a relationship, it can become difficult to manage if both partners don't have an outlet. To avoid an unhealthy buildup of tension and to foster a productive relationship, it is important to find activities that both partners can engage in together. Taking time for leisure activities can help relieve stress and build closeness between partners. 
Leisure activities come in many forms, but the best activities to reduce stress in a relationship are those that build upon the relationship’s positive aspects. Doing activities that you both enjoy can help build a deeper connection and help the flow of energy in the relationship. Some popular leisure activities to do together are: 
• Going for walks: Taking a stroll in a quiet park or nature area can be a great way to relax and unwind. Going for walks together can also be a great opportunity for both partners to talk about their day and find out more about each other. 
• Board games: Playing board game together can be a great way to have some fun and release stress. Whether you prefer chess or Monopoly, or something like Trivial Pursuit or Boggle, there is an option for everyone. 
• Cooking: Trying a new recipe together can be a great way to learn new skills, express creativity, and enjoy each other’s company. 
• Media: Watching a movie together or binge-watching a tv show on Netflix can be a great way to relax and have fun together. You can use this time to chat about the movie or show and discuss your thoughts on it.
• Outdoor activities: Going camping or doing water sports are some of the best activities to do outside. Depending on your interest level, these activities can be relaxing or more active.
These activities can be the key to lessening the stress in your relationship and building upon the positives. However, it is important to remember that these activities are only a small part of managing stress. It is important to also take some time to separate yourselves from the relationship and focus on self-care. Taking some time apart to do activities that make you feel better is essential and will help make the relationship more productive. Ultimately, leisure activities are an important part in managing stress in any relationship and can be the perfect way to build intimacy and connection.

Title: Giving Respect in a Relationship: Learning to Prioritize Mutual Respect 
The foundation of a successful relationship lies in mutual respect. Maintaining respect in a relationship is something that must be continuously done; it’s not a one-time thing. Respect is the cornerstone of any relationship and the basis of a healthy connection. Respect underlies feelings of trust and security, enabling couples to survive and grow together.
When couples learn to prioritize mutual respect and practice it in their relationship, it helps to create a strong bond between them. A relationship that has mutual respect at its core is one where both partners feel valued and understood, and where each partner is equally appreciated and respected. 
The first step in developing mutual respect is to identify each other’s values and goals. By doing this, the partners can understand where each other is coming from, and where they differ. When there is a lack of understanding or knowledge, it can often lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding. Therefore, it’s important for both individuals to take the time to ask questions and really listen to each other. Having an open dialogue that encourages each partner to share their thoughts, values and beliefs without fear of judgement is an essential part of developing mutual respect.
Once both partners have identified each other’s values, it’s important to take the time to prioritize them in the relationship. This means understanding that each partner’s values and goals are equally important and should be respected in the relationship. For example, if one partner’s goal is to get their degree, the other partner should be understanding and supportive of that. This kind of support and respect helps to strengthen the relationship and create a deeper connection.
Overall, developing mutual respect in a relationship is essential for it to thrive. Taking the time to identify each other’s values and goals, and then prioritize them, is a process that will bring couples closer together and help to build a strong and lasting relationship.

The Impact of Jealousy on Trust in Relationships
At the very core of any relationship lies trust. Without trust, many couples are unable to make it through the challenges life throws at them. Indeed, feeling secure in a relationship with someone is the very foundation for love to build upon.
Jealousy is a common emotion that appears in many relationships and can have a serious impact on trust. Jealousy can range from minor feelings of insecurity to strong feelings of fear and anxiety. In a nutshell, jealousy is an emotion that arises when one partner suspects that their partner is paying attention or giving attention to another person. It can also arise if one partner feels like the other partner is not giving enough attention or love to them.
When jealousy arises, it can lead to distrust between both partners. People can start to doubt their partnerâ€™s intentions and become suspicious of their activities outside of the relationship. People may even begin to think that their partner is being unfaithful or is not giving them enough love and attention. If the jealousy is left unchecked, it can lead to serious quarrels and arguments between couples which can weaken the trust within the relationship and cause further distrust. 
The best way to build trust is to be honest and open with your partner. Show your partner that you value their needs and feelings and be sure to communicate your thoughts and feelings with your partner. It is important to talk openly and honestly with your partner, setting boundaries and expectations that both partners can respect and follow. Jealousy can be a normal emotion, but it should not be allowed to take over the trust that is necessary for any relationship. When jealousy does arise, it's important for both partners to communicate openly and honestly to ensure the trust between them is maintained.

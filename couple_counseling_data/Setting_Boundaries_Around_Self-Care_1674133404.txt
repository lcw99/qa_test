Title: Setting Boundaries Around Self-Care: Prioritizing Self-Care in a Couples or Girlfriend/Boyfriend Relationship
When it comes to maintaining a healthy relationship with a partner, it is important to prioritize self-care. Self-care can be defined as activities that one does to take care of their own physical, mental and emotional needs. Taking care of oneself is important in any relationship, but it can be especially difficult to set boundaries around self-care for couples or for those in a romantic relationship. 
Setting boundaries around self-care is an important but often overlooked part of maintaining healthy relationships. It is important for both parties to be able to set boundaries around how much time and energy they are able to give and receive from their significant other. By doing so, both people can feel secure in knowing that their needs are being met and respected. 
The first step to setting boundaries around self-care is to communicate with your partner. It is important to be honest and open about your needs and expectations within the relationship. This will help create an understanding between both parties and allow for a mutually beneficial relationship. 
It is also important to focus on the present when setting boundaries around self-care. Focusing on what is happening in the moment and discussing any potential changes that need to be made to ensure both parties are taken care of can be beneficial. This can help both people in the relationship better understand each other and make sure neither person feels neglected. 
Finally, it is important to be flexible when setting boundaries around self-care. Like any relationship, self-care boundaries can shift and change over time. It is important to be open to new ways of expressing and meeting oneâ€™s needs and to be willing to adjust boundaries if needed. 
Setting boundaries around self-care is an important aspect of maintaining healthy relationships. Taking the time to openly communicate with your partner and be conscious of your needs and the needs of your partner can help create a more secure and fulfilling relationship for both parties.

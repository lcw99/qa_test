Title: Setting Realistic Relationship Goals for Couples 
Subtitle: How to Create and Reach Short-term and Long-term Goals
Setting goals for a relationship is a great way to stay healthy, growing and connected with your partner. Whether you are looking to establish short-term goals or long-term goals, it is essential to have a plan in place and to be dedicated to achieving them. 
When it comes to setting goals in a relationship, it is important to be realistic. If you make expectations that are too high, it can lead to disappointment and frustration. If you set goals that are too low, then your relationship can become stagnant and unfulfilling. Therefore, it is important to come up with goals that are achievable and that both partners are willing to work towards. 
When creating goals, it is important to determine whether they are short-term or long-term goals. Short-term goals are those that can be achieved in a few months or less. These goals are often meant to help the couple in the present and can involve improving communication or sorting out a disagreement. On the other hand, long-term goals involve working towards a greater, longer-term goal. These are typically goals that involve a larger commitment, such as marriage or a move to a different city. 
Once goals are established, it is important to discuss how to achieve them. Every couple will have different ideas of how to achieve goals and it is important to talk about these ideas in order to be successful. Communication is key in achieving goals in a relationship, so it is important to ensure that both partners are fully engaged in the process. 
By setting realistic goals and discussing how to achieve them, couples can stay connected and continue to grow as a team. Whether your goals are short-term or long-term, it is essential to have a plan and to work on them together. Through dedication and communication, couples can stay healthy and happy as they work towards their relationship goals.

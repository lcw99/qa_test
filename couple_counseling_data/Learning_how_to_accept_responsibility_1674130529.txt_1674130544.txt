How to Own Your Role in Conflict Resolution: Learning to Accept Responsibility
By Steven Smith 
Conflict resolution is a crucial step in any couple or relationship. Learning how to resolve disagreements in an effective and healthy way is an essential part of a healthy relationship. In order to be able to successfully resolve conflicts, it is important to learn how to accept responsibility and recognize your role in the conflict.
Accepting responsibility is the first step in resolving conflicts. Rather than pointing fingers and placing blame, assessing your role in the conflict is the key to understanding why the conflict arose in the first place. Taking a step back, looking at the problem objectively, and recognizing your responsibility in the matter is essential. No one is perfect, and having the humility to see your mistakes and own up to them is the key to successful conflict resolution.
The second step to successfully resolving conflicts is to learn how to compromise. When two people are in a disagreement, it is important to realize that both parties’ needs and wants need to be taken into consideration and each person must be willing to give a little in order to meet in the middle. Compromising is a useful way to come to an agreement and will help foster a sense of mutual respect.
Finally, learning effective communication techniques and being willing to actively listen to each other is essential when it comes to resolving conflicts. Communication is the key to understanding each other’s perspectives and needs. It is important to actively listen and avoid jumping to conclusions or assumptions. Openly discussing the situation and being understanding of each other’s feelings is the best way to come to a resolution.
Learning how to accept responsibility, compromise, and communicate effectively when dealing with conflicts is an important part of any relationship. Taking the time to understand and recognize your role in the conflict is the key to successful and healthy conflict resolution.

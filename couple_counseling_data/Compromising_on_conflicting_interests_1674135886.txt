Title: Compromising on Conflicting Interests in a Relationship: How Partners Can Balance Individual Priorities 
Having a relationship is a twofold process of understanding and respecting both yourself and your partner while seeking a mutual balance of interests. It is normal that both of you will have individual goals, desires and expectations that may not always align, but compromise is possible when conflicting interests arise in a relationship. It is important to be aware of the ways in which each partner's individual priorities can be navigated so that the relationship can remain healthy and strong. 
When interests conflict, it is essential to start a conversation and strive to come to a mutual agreement. This conversation should take the form of a dialogue where both parties are heard and both sides are taken into account. It is imperative to remember that no one is 'right' or 'wrong' when it comes to what matters to each partner, so judgement should be avoided and instead, each individual should strive to communicate their needs and perspective in a respectful, understanding way.
It is important to remain flexible and open-minded when offering different solutions for how to move forward. In general, it is best to avoid an 'all-or-nothing' approach. Instead, seeking to identify mid-way points and compromises that can bridge the gap in interests may be a more productive approach. This could involve setting aside specific times for each partner to pursue their individual goals, or taking turns in deciding what activities the couple will do together. Being able to find a balance that takes each person's needs into account is a valuable way to resolve issues and keep the relationship healthy.
It is understandable that when interests conflict, it can be a challenging situation to navigate. However, it is possible to remain flexible and seek to find a solution that meets the needs of both partners. Compromise is not easy but it is a necessary part of any relationship. Identifying and prioritizing goals and values in a relationship is possible when both partners are open, understanding and willing to work together to find a balance of interests.

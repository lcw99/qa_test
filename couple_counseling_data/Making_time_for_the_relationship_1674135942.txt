Making Time for the Relationship: Balancing Individual and Couple Priorities 
When starting a new relationship, determining priorities and values can seem like a daunting task. It’s important to consider both individual and couple priorities when it comes to making time for each other. Couples need to recognize that it takes two individuals to get it right and meeting in the middle is key.
One effective way of managing both individual and couple priorities is to come to a consensus on the aspects of each other’s lives that require attention. Whether it’s work, school, family commitments, or simply taking care of yourself, it’s important to be open and honest about what you need help with and how it will affect your time together.
Once agreements have been made, it’s important to stick to them. Scheduling time for the relationship is paramount to making it a priority. This can be done through regular dates and activities, communicating over the phone or online, or simply carving out time to be alone together. Building in quality time is essential to make the relationship strong.
In the end, making time for the relationship involves identifying and setting individual and couple goals and values. Taking time to discuss and create boundaries around each partner’s individual priorities and everyday commitments can help ensure that the relationship grows and prospers. It is only through understanding one another’s lives and creating balance between individual and couple priorities that couples can make time for their relationship.

Title: Conflict Resolution: Understanding Different Conflict Styles
In many couple and boyfriend/girlfriend relationships, learning how to productively navigate a conflict may be difficult. It is important to be aware of the different conflict styles in order to recognize what works and what does not for your relationship. Knowing different conflict styles can help you better understand yourself and your partner, so that resolving conflicts can become easier and more productive.
The first conflict style is Competing. According to the American Psychological Association, someone with a competing conflict style expects to win and will use strategies like arguing and making convincing points in order to dominate the conversation. This can be seen in conversations where there is a lot of arguing and debate in order to come to a resolution.
The second conflict style is Accommodating. A person with an accommodating conflict style will put their partner's needs before their own and are willing to sacrifice their own wants and desires in order to make their partner happy. This style focuses on harmony, but can lead to resentment if one person feels like they are getting taken advantage of.
The third conflict style is Avoiding. This style is characterized by an unwillingness to confront difficult conversations. A person with an avoiding conflict style will ignore the problem and try to avoid a confrontation. This style can lead to the issue being unresolved, which can be damaging to a relationship.
The fourth conflict style is Compromising. This style is characterized by both parties trying to find a solution that is mutually beneficial. It is important to remember that compromise does not mean that both parties get exactly what they want, but that both sides will get something out of the conversation.
The fifth conflict style is Collaborating. This style focuses on problem solving in a creative way and finding a solution that works for everyone. It is important to remember that this style of conflict resolution requires both parties to be open to new possibilities and to communicate their feelings openly.
No matter what your individual conflict style is, it is important to remember that each style can be valuable in its own way. Investing the time to understand each other's styles and talking openly about what works and what doesn't can help to better navigate future conflicts. With open communication, understanding, and patience, you and your partner can learn how to resolve conflicts in a healthy and productive way.

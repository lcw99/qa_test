The Power of Understanding: Showing Empathetic Support to Your Partner
When it comes to creating and nurturing strong and healthy relationships, showing understanding and showing support are essential. In a world where people are constantly bombarded with messages of comparison and judgement, having someone who is willing to listen and understand without judgement can be invaluable. 
Understanding and showing support doesn't always have to be verbal. Showing understanding can be done in many ways. An act of kindness or understanding can go a long way in helping to create a positive and reciprocal relationship dynamic. Acknowledging, validating, and empathizing with your partner's emotions can also be incredibly powerful.
For example, a partner may want to share their upset over a failed job interview. When providing support, it's important to resist the urge to offer solutions, but instead show understanding by empathizing and validating the feeling. It's important to remember to stay focused on the other person and not make it about you.
It's also important to remember that when we show understanding and empathy to our partners, we're also creating an atmosphere of acceptance. It can be helpful to use "I" statements as it can help to support the idea that each partner is responsible for their own feelings and emotions.
By understanding and showing support to our partners, we are able to build trust and create a stronger relationship. Understanding and showing support to our partners doesn't mean that we have to always agree on every issue or situation, it simply means that we are open and willing to listen to their perspective and look for solutions that are mutually beneficial. Providing your partner with understanding and support can be an incredibly powerful tool in building trust and helping to shape a strong relationship.

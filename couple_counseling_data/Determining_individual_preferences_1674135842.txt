Title: Competing Priorities: Navigating the Tension of Individual Preferences in Couples
It is inevitable that two individuals, even in a happy, healthy relationship, will have differences in their personal goals and values. As a couple, it is important to recognize and celebrate each partner's unique preferences, while also learning how to create a balance in the relationship. Competing priorities can create tension if not handled in the right way. Through setting individual boundaries, proactively communicating, and practicing mutual respect and understanding, partners can identify and prioritize the goals and values that are important in the relationship.
Before making decisions as a couple, it is beneficial to first understand and consider each person's individual preferences. Taking time to talk with your partner about goals, values and motivations can be a great way to clarify the priorities of both partners. When issues arise, it is important to approach topics with an open mind and to seek compromise. Rather than getting stuck in a battle between two conflicting points of view, focus on finding understanding and empathy. Acknowledge the importance of both perspectives and aim to come to an agreement that reflects the mutual priorities of both partners.
Every couple needs to decide on their own set of boundaries and terms. Make sure to agree on the framework of the relationship and create realistic expectations. Once clear boundaries, values and expectations have been set, couples can make decisions based on what works for them, rather than fighting over differences in individual preferences.
Communication is key in navigating the tension of individual priorities in a couples’ relationship. It is important for each partner to practice active listening, without judgement or criticism. Proper communication can create a positive relationship, in which both partners feel heard, appreciated, and respected.
Finally, mutual respect and understanding can help couples prioritize goals and values in their relationship. It is important to be conscious of what each partner brings to the relationship and how that can be beneficial to both partners individually, and to the relationship as a whole. When two individual preferences are at odds, work together to develop an understanding and appreciation of the other’s point of view. 
By recognizing and celebrating individual preferences, setting boundaries, proactively communicating, and practicing mutual respect and understanding, couples can identify and prioritize the goals and values that are important in the relationship. By keeping these best practices in mind, couples can determine their priorities, navigate the tension of individual differences, and create a healthy, happy relationship.

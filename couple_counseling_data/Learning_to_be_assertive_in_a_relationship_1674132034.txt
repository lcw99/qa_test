By ____________
Conflicts are inevitable in any long-term relationship. How you choose to handle these disagreements can either strengthen or weaken the connection between you and your partner. In order to keep your relationship healthy and productive, learning how to be assertive in your relationship is a must. Assertiveness can allow both parties to resolve differences without losing their respect or compromising their values. Here are some tips on how to be assertive and resolve conflicts in a relationship.
1. Identify the Problem - Before you can address an issue within the relationship, it’s important to first identify the problem. If you’re feeling hurt, angry, or resentful, try to find out what triggered these feelings. Taking a few minutes to reflect on the situation can help you better understand why you are feeling the way you are. 
2. Communicate Your Feelings - Once you’ve identified the issue, communicate your feelings to your partner. Explain the feelings that you’re experiencing and why you’re feeling them. This will help your partner understand where you’re coming from and help them relate to the situation better.
3. Listen and Empathize - It’s important to understand your partner’s perspective before you can work towards a resolution. Take the time to really listen to your partner and try to empathize with how they are feeling. You don’t necessarily have to agree on the issue, but being able to understand where your partner is coming from is key. 
4. Find Common Ground - After understanding each other’s needs, finding common ground is the next step towards reaching an agreement. Focus on what you both can agree on and use that as a starting point to find a solution.
5. Be Self-Aware - As you’re working towards a resolution, be self-aware of your body language and tone of voice. Being aware of how you’re presenting yourself can help the conversation stay productive and prevent it from turning into an argument.
Learning how to be assertive in your relationship is essential to conflict resolution. It can help both parties express their feelings and find resolutions that work for everyone. By following these tips, you can work towards a healthier, more productive relationship.

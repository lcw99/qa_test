Discussing Retirement Plans: A Guide to Strengthening Your Financial Goals as a Couple
For couples, discussing retirement plans is an important part of setting and achieving financial goals. While it's common to have separate retirement accounts, it's important to discuss and plan together to ensure both partners are financially secure in retirement. Here are a few tips to help you start the conversation.
1. Talk about what you want your retirement to look like. Do you have specific places you want to travel to or activities you want to do? Consider the lifestyle you want to maintain, how much you’ll need to live on and how to make that goal a reality.
2. Decide who will handle the retirement planning. One partner may be more financially savvy than the other, so it’s important to decide who will be responsible for managing the retirement accounts and investments.
3. Talk about joint savings accounts. Are you both willing to contribute to a joint account that can be used to meet retirement goals? If so, decide how much each of you will put in, and how frequently.
4. Look into tax implications. How will investments be taxed, how much will you owe in retirement, and does your state provide any incentives for retirement savings?
5. Discuss whether or not you want to retire together. This is especially important if either partner is considering a career change or working part-time in retirement.
Discussing retirement plans isn't always easy, but it’s an important conversation to have in order to ensure financial stability for your future. Talking about goals and managing money together is a great way to get on the same page, and it can help strengthen your relationship.

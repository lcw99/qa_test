How to Decide Who Gets What Credit Card in a Couple 
Credit cards are a useful tool for many couples, helping them to manage their money better, build credit and make everyday purchases easier. But, when a couple decides to have credit cards, it isn’t always easy to decide who should get which one. Here are some tips to help couples decide who gets what credit card in their relationship:
1. Figure Out Your Goals. The first thing that couples should do when deciding who gets what credit card is to figure out what they want to accomplish by having credit cards. Are they looking to build each other’s credit, or are they just looking to manage their money better? Knowing the goals they want to achieve with credit cards will help to narrow down the type of card that works best for them.
2. Consider Your Financial Responsibilities. It’s important that couples think about how each person will handle their financial responsibilities. If one person tends to overspend, or is more comfortable using cash, a credit card may not be the best option for them. On the other hand, if one person is a careful spender, and is comfortable with managing credit, then they may be better suited to have a credit card.
3. Compare Your Credit Scores. Different credit cards have different qualification requirements. If one person has a higher credit score than the other, it’s important to compare the two credit scores before deciding who gets what credit card. This way, each person can get the best credit card that they are eligible for.
4. Create a Budget. Before a couple decides who gets what credit card, they need to make a budget. This budget should include how much they expect to pay on their credit cards each month and what their financial goals are. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that each person is comfortable with the level of debt they will be taking on.
These are just a few tips to help couples decide who should get what credit card in their relationship. This process should not be rushed, and couples should take their time to ensure they select the right card to meet their financial needs.

Title: Prioritizing Self-Care in Relationships: Supporting Each Other’s Goals 
Couples can often get caught up in the day-to-day, dealing with the stresses of having a relationship, and can forget to take the necessary time to prioritize their own self-care. Self-care is important for many reasons, but especially when it comes to relationships. It's important for couples to remember that even in the midst of a committed relationship, it is essential to prioritize self-care, and to help each other in doing so. 
Having support from a partner when it comes to self-care can be of great benefit. It can help to create balance and remind both partners that they need to take care of themselves in order to take care of each other. Having a partner that understands and values self-care can make it easier to prioritize it.
Partners can support each other's self-care goals in a variety of ways. It is important to communicate your self-care goals to your partner, so that it is clear what you need from them. A few ways in which partners can help each other in their self-care pursuits include:
• Helping to create time: Making sure that both of you have enough time to dedicate to your own self-care can be hard, especially when both of you are juggling your own responsibilities, activities and other tasks. A small gesture like helping to create time for each other can go a long way. 
• Listening and being there: Supporting each other emotionally can be just as important as supporting each other physically. Having a partner that can be there when you need someone to talk to, or to just listen to how you're feeling, can be a great source of comfort. 
• Doing activities together: Doing activities together that foster connection can put both partners on the same page, and help to create and maintain intimacy. Doing something together like yoga, a walk in the park, or cooking can be a great way to destress and enjoy each other's company.
• Encouraging self-care: Encouraging each other to make time for self-care and to take care of yourself is important. Having a partner that can encourage you when you're feeling down can help to remind you that it's OK to take a break and do something just for yourself. 
Ultimately, prioritizing self-care in relationships is essential. Taking the time to support each other in each other's self-care pursuits can go a long way in helping couples to create balance in their relationship and to lead healthy, fulfilling lives. Taking the time to support each other in your self-care pursuits can be a great way to strengthen your relationship and to foster a deeper connection.

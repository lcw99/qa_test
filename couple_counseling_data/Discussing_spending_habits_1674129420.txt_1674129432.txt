Title: Understanding Spending Habits in a Relationship
Subtitle: How to Communicate and Set Financial Goals Together 
Relationships are not only about sharing love, but also about sharing financial responsibilities and goals. When two people come together to form a romantic bond, their finances must be taken into account. One of the most important things to make sure of is discussing both individual's spending habits, so that each partner can understand the financial situation of the other. Being on the same page when it comes to money matters can save a relationship from a lot of stress, so it’s best to start the discussion early on.
The first step towards discussing spending habits is to be honest and open. It can be difficult to admit that you’re not managing money as well as you’d like, but it’s the only way to move forward. Honesty and transparency are key in any relationship and this is especially true when it comes to money. Remember that both partners must be willing to share this information in a non-judgmental way in order for the conversation to be productive. 
Once both partners have spoken about their spending habits, it’s time to set some financial goals. This could include short-term and long-term goals such as saving for a house deposit, a dream holiday, retirement or other important milestones. The important thing is to be realistic and make sure that both partners are on the same page. It can be helpful to set dates for when certain goals should be achieved by and assign tasks that each partner can take on in order to reach them.
Finally, it’s important to understand that money and finances are an ongoing discussion. A relationship is a living, breathing thing and circumstances can change and require further adaptions to financial goals. That’s why it’s important to remain transparent and have regular discussions about finances to ensure that both partners are on the same page.
Discussing spending habits and setting financial goals is never an easy task, but it’s essential to make sure that both partners can understand each other and reach a common agreement. With enough honesty, transparency and understanding, couples can come to an agreement that suits both of their circumstances.

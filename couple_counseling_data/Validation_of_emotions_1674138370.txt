Validation: A Key Element of Emotional Support in Relationships
Feeling heard and accepted is an essential part of any relationship. Emotional support, a term that encompasses understanding, acceptance and validation, is a key component of a healthy and thriving relationship. 
Validation is the verbal and nonverbal recognition of someone else’s feelings and experiences and is essential in a relationship. It is the act of understanding, acknowledging, and accepting another person's reality, even if it is different from our own. It is a crucial skill in any relationship and helps build trust and understanding. 
Validation can come in many forms, from merely listening and understanding to verbally affirming another’s emotions. We may not be able to relate to our partner’s emotions all the time, but it is important to recognize and respect these feelings regardless. When we validate our partner, we do not have to agree with them or give advice. We merely let them know that we have heard and understood their feelings.
Validation can help our partner feel heard, seen, and appreciated. It is a way of letting our partner know that we understand the emotion they are feeling and that we empathize and accept what they are going through. This can help build trust and revelry in our relationship, and make difficult conversations easier to navigate. 
Providing our partner with emotional support and validation is a great way to show your commitment and dedication to them. It is also an important step in developing healthy communication and understanding. With patience and practice, it can help create an atmosphere of trust, acceptance and understanding in your relationship.

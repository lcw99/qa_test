Title: The Stress of Relationships: Understanding How Stress Impacts Self-Care 
Self-care is a vital part of any relationship, yet it is one of the most overlooked aspects by couples. It is important to discuss the importance of self-care and how to prioritize it in order to have a healthy, balanced relationship. One aspect of self-care that is often overlooked is understanding the impact of stress. 
When it comes to relationships, there is a multitude of stressors. As relationships progress and evolve, there is often the added pressure of having to learn a new way to communicate, navigating boundary setting, and managing expectations of each another. These stressors can create a negative cycle, in which each partner feels negatively affected by the other, leading to an increase in stress and tension. 
The impact of this stress can be detrimental to self-care. It often prevents couples from reflecting on, or having meaningful conversations about their relationship, as both partners may be feeling overwhelmed by the stress. This can lead to a lack of self-care, such as unhealthy habits, self-isolation, or even lashing out in anger.
In order for couples to successfully take care of themselves, it is important to understand the impact of stress on self-care. As a couple, it is important to create boundaries and maintain open communication. This can help to reduce stress and create a safe space in which both partners can practice self-care. Together, discuss and plan moments of self-care, such as time spent alone, activities shared together, or even seeking professional help if needed.
Prioritizing self-care in relationships is key to developing and maintaining a healthy, balanced relationship. As a couple, it is important to understand the impact of stress on self-care and to use it as an opportunity to engage in meaningful dialogue. Taking the time to practice self-care together can create a stronger, more fulfilling relationship for both partners.

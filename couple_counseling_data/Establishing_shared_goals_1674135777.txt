Title: The Power of Shared Goals in a Couple Relationship
Subtitle: Strategies for Setting and Achieving Goals Together
Having a clear understanding of shared goals within a couple relationship can create a strengthened bond and mutual understanding. Goals don’t necessarily have to be serious or long-term. Small goals help couples to focus on accomplishing activities that bring them closer together and help them to strengthen the relationship. Working towards common goals can bring a sense of unity and collaboration that reinforces the positive aspects of the relationship. 
Creating shared goals within a couple relationship can be a challenging endeavor. It is important to remember to value the goals and perspectives of each partner in the relationship. Consider what each partner wants to achieve, and talk openly about working together to achieve those goals. Taking time to think carefully and discuss these goals is step one in a process that allows couples to build trust, understanding, and a stronger bond. 
Once couples have identified and discussed the goals they have for their relationship, they need to develop a plan for achieving these goals. Achievable goals often bring the most satisfaction. Break larger goals up into smaller tasks, and then specify how each partner can contribute to completing each task. Identifying specific roles for each partner in achieving shared goals brings clarity for each partner, and provides a sense of accomplishment when tasks are finished. 
In addition to setting goals, couples should also give each other the freedom to pursue individual goals and interests. Respect for each partner’s independence and the freedom to explore individual pursuits is an important part of any strong relationship. This helps to ensure each partner maintains a sense of self, and will help to create a balanced relationship. 
Prioritizing goals and developing a plan to achieve them is an important part of having a successful couple relationship. Establishing a clear understanding of shared goals and roles within the relationship will help couples to remain focused and have a stronger bond. Couples should not forget to leave room to pursue individual interests and goals in order to create a healthy and balanced relationship.

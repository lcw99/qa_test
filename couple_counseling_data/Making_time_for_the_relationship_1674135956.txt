Making Time for the Relationship: Identifying and Prioritizing Goals and Values in Couples and Boyfriend/Girlfriend Relationships
By ________
Every relationship—whether a couple, boyfriend/girlfriend, or platonic—requires dedication and maintenance to remain healthy and continue to grow. Making time for the relationship and understanding the importance of prioritizing goals and values is essential for its success.
When it comes to spending time together, couples and partners often find themselves competing with outside commitments. This could include a job, family, friends, extracurricular activities, recreational activities, or a combination of all. It’s important for couples and partners to make time for their relationship amid all of these outside obligations.
The way to make time for the relationship is to identify and prioritize the goals and values that both partners believe in. This begins by having a conversation and understanding the needs, goals, and desires of each partner. By having an open dialogue, couples can come to a consensus and find ways to make the relationship work in tandem with their other commitments.
Writing down goals and values can be a great way to solidify and remind couples of their priorities. This could be done by creating a “couples bucket list” and setting aside time each month to check off one or two goals. It could also involve having weekly or biweekly check-in meetings to discuss what’s going well and what can be improved.
Once couples have identified and prioritized their goals and values, they can then begin to make time for the relationship. This could include setting aside date nights, spending one-on-one time together on a regular basis, or engaging in activities that both partners enjoy. This is also a great opportunity to discuss any issues or topics that might be hard to bring up in a casual setting.
The key to any relationship is communication. Making time for the relationship and understanding the importance of goals and values are essential for maintaining a healthy relationship. By having an open dialogue and making sure to prioritize the relationship amidst other commitments, couples will be able to form and nurture a strong bond.

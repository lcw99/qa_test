Active Listening: Learning to Reflect on What Was Said in Relationships
Having the ability to actively listen and reflect on what one’s significant other is saying is a fundamental skill that all couples and relationships should strive to possess. With strong listening skills, people are better able to understand each other. By being an active listener and reflecting on what is said, relationships can become more in sync and communication can be improved in a meaningful and lasting way.
First and foremost, it is important to be a conscious listener. That is, pay attention to what is being said. Practice being present in the moment rather than getting lost in one’s own thoughts. This will ensure that one is better able to truly focus on what their significant other is saying.
The next step is to practice reflecting on what was said. This can be done by actively engaging in conversation. Ask open-ended questions that show one is making an effort to understand the conversation. Repeat back what one’s significant other has said in order to ensure comprehension and to let the other person know one is paying attention. Sharing one’s own experiences or thoughts that are relevant to the conversation can help keep the conversation going and in a productive manner. 
Lastly, it’s important to recognize and be aware of body language. Sometimes body language can give subtle clues as to what a person is feeling or thinking. Being aware of this can create a more meaningful conversation as one is better able to understand the feelings and emotions involved with what was said.
Practicing active listening and reflecting on what was said is a skill that relationships should actively work to develop. This skill can create a more meaningful relationship that is rooted in understanding and support.

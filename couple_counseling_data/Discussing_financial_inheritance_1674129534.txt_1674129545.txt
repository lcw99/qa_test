The Financial Conundrum of Inheritance: Exploring How Couples Can Talk About Inheritance
When it comes to relationship dynamics, discussing finances can be one of the most difficult topics for couples to broach. This is especially the case for couples discussing financial inheritances. It's important to be mindful when you and your partner are talking about financial inheritance. To ensure it's a productive and beneficial conversation, here are a few tips to keep in mind.
The first step is to create a safe and comfortable space for you and your partner to talk openly. Even if you think you know where your partner stands with inheritance, it's important you both come to the discussion with an open mind. It's also important to be honest and candid with one another. It could be difficult to talk about money, so consider starting this conversation with a question like, "What do you think about financial inheritances?".
That said, it's important to talk about inheritance with a focus on the future instead of the past. Think about how a financial inheritance may affect your future plans such as buying a house or starting a business venture. Talk about how it may be allocated as either a short-term goal or long-term goal. 
Continue the conversation by exploring your partner's feelings about inheritances. If you're the one receiving the inheritance, talk about how you plan to manage it and how it will be used. While talking about finances can be difficult, it's necessary in order to build a strong foundation for your relationship. 
Finally, it's important to talk about the potential conflicts that could arise with financial inheritances. Talk about how it may affect other areas of your relationship such as communication, values, and shared goals. Discuss how you would handle such conflicts and come up with a plan of action. 
By discussing financial inheritances, couples can ensure their finances are managed appropriately and their relationship can benefit from harmony when it comes to dealing with money. Having a clear and open understanding of inheritance can be an important step towards financial success as a couple.

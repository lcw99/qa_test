Coping With Stress: Examining Sources of Support in Relationships
Couples, whether in new relationships or long-term partnerships, often face stress triggered by problems related to money, work, family, or health. Stress can lead to both physical and mental exhaustion, and can create challenges in relationships. Fortunately, there are several sources of external and internal support that couples can explore to help them manage and cope with stressful times.
External Sources of Support
When it comes to seeking support during moments of stress, one of the most obvious places to look is outside of the relationship. Friends, family members, colleagues, and support groups can be an invaluable source of advice, reassurance, and help. Couples should strive to find a network of trusted and reliable support systems of people who can provide compassionate listening, practical help, and honest feedback. If needed, couples can also reach out to professional therapists, who can help them work through any underlying issues and challenging dynamics related to the stress.
Internal Sources of Support
For couples, being able to provide each other with emotional and practical support is paramount. Even if couples don't experience the same stress, by being present for each other, offering words of encouragement, and actively listening to each other, they can create a mutual sense of understanding and acceptance. Additionally, couples can prioritize self-care, both individually and as a couple, by focusing on activities they enjoy together such as cooking together, engaging in exercise, or taking a relaxing walk. Finally, couples can learn to practice mindfulness as a way to reconnect with one another, ground themselves in the present moment, and take a break from the stress that can often cloud other aspects of the relationship.
Conclusion
When couples experience stress together, they can use the resources and skills they have to navigate it. By exploring both external and internal sources of support, couples can learn to better manage and cope with the stresses of life.

Tackling Stress Together: Developing a Positive Attitude
By Karen Beck
Stress is an unavoidable part of life, and having a positive attitude—particularly when going through a difficult time—is key to managing it. Couples who face challenging experiences together have an advantage—their mutual support and understanding can help buffer and lessen the impact of stress. Here are some tips to help couples develop a positive attitude while working together to manage stress.
Focus on Gratitude
No matter how bad a situation may seem, take time to focus on the positive. Proactively looking for things to be grateful for can help both partners feel more relaxed and peaceful. This could involve counting their blessings, or writing down small or large things that they are grateful for each day. 
Embrace Opportunities for Growth
Instead of solely viewing stress as a negative, couples can view it as a way to strengthen their relationship. Stressful situations can present opportunities for growth, and if couples can face them together, it can help build a stronger partnership. Working through stressful times as a unit can lead to greater connection, communication, and a sense of accomplishment.
Take Time for Self-Care
It is important to make time to relax, decompress, and nourish oneself and one’s relationship. Taking a break from the stress and taking time for self-care can help restore the peace of mind and the spirit of appreciation needed to stay positive. This could involve anything from taking a hot bath to going out to dinner.
Communicate Openly
Open and honest communication is a cornerstone of any relationship. During times of stress, take the time to talk to each other about the challenges being faced and how each of you is feeling. Make sure to set aside time to talk, even if it is just 5 minutes a day. Having clear and respectful communication will help ease tension and cultivate a feeling of unity within the relationship.
Develop a Positive Mindset
Ultimately, developing a positive mindset is key to managing stress in any relationship. Focusing on the good can help couples view any situation from a more optimistic standpoint. This could involve taking a positive approach to problems, focusing on the future, or trying to identify the lessons in any adversity.
By focusing on gratitude, embracing opportunities for growth, taking time for self-care, communicating openly, and cultivating a positive mindset, couples can work together to manage stress and stay connected. Having a supportive and understanding partner is the perfect companion for tackling the challenges of life with a positive attitude.

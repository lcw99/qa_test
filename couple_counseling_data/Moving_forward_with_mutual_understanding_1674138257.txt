Learning to Forgive and Move Forward in Relationships: Establishing Mutual Understanding
By John Doe
No matter how strong and loving a relationship may be, mistakes and conflicts are inevitable at times. It can be difficult to find the balance between staying with the person you love and moving on from the hurt and pain of the mistake or conflict. Fortunately, both outcomes are possible if we learn how to forgive and move forward with mutual understanding. 
Before you are able to reach a place of forgiveness and understanding, it is important that both partners absolutely trust each other. If you do not feel trust in the relationship, then it would be best to take a step back and investigate the source of that mistrust. It could be arising from a variety of sources, such as the mistake or conflict in question, or a deeper trust or communication issue in the relationship. Once clear and honest communication can exist between two partners, forgiveness and understanding has a chance to develop.
Once there is trust in the relationship, the next step is to work on understanding each other and the mistake or conflict. Both partners need to be diligent in listening to each other's words and points of view. This is the time to show patience and empathy toward each other, as it is important to recognize that the other person's feelings and opinions are valid and important.
The final step in learning how to forgive and move forward with mutual understanding is to apologize and, more importantly, to accept one another’s apology. Apologies should be sincere and, if needed, followed up with an action to prevent the same mistake from happening again. This can require some compromise from both partners as to how things are going to change moving forward, and a willingness to forgive each other for any feelings that were hurt in the heat of the conflict or mistake.
Forgiving and moving forward with mutual understanding can be a difficult journey, but it can be done with the right communication and trust in the relationship. It is important to recognize and appreciate each other’s feelings and opinions, and to be willing to apologize and accept one another’s apologies. If done correctly, relationships can be strengthened and deepened through the process of learning how to forgive and move forward with mutual understanding.

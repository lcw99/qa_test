Making Room in Your Budget: Prioritizing Expenses During Couples Discussions About Financial Goals 
When discussing finances, couples often focus on large-scale issues like retirement funds, budgeting, and debt. While understanding and addressing these topics is important, it is equally essential for couples to consider how to prioritize their day-to-day expenses. This can help the two of you to create a plan for managing your money together in the present and for the future.
Creating a budget and prioritizing expenses is one of the most powerful things a couple can do when it comes to financial goals. A budget serves as a guide for setting boundaries on spending and can help couples to more easily reach their goals. To create a budget, it’s important that couples identify both fixed and discretionary expenses and then decide which ones will take priority in their spending plan.
Fixed expenses, like rent, utilities, and insurance, are necessary items that don’t vary from month to month. They are expenses that must be paid each month in order to maintain the lifestyle that the couple has become accustomed to. Discretionary expenses, such as entertainment and dining out, are expenses that are not essential to maintain a certain lifestyle. Couples should look at these types of expenses and decide which ones will take priority.
While brainstorming about priorities for spending, couples should also consider their long-term goals and decide which financial decisions will be most helpful for achieving those goals. If a couple wants to purchase a house in, say, five years, then they might decide to put a larger portion of their income toward a down payment. Prioritizing savings can have a huge impact on your current and future financial situation.
It’s also important for couples to discuss potential pitfalls to their budget. For example, if one partner incurs a lot of debt due to unexpected expenses, the couple should discuss ways to manage the debt and come up with a strategy for repaying it. Couples should also talk about how much of a cushion they want to maintain in the event of unexpected expenses.
Ultimately, having honest and open conversations about finances can help couples stay on the same page when it comes to their present and future financial goals. Prioritizing expenses can help couples to make the most of their money and provide them with the best chance of success in meeting their financial goals.

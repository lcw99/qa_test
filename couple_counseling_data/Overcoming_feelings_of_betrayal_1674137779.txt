Subtitle: How to Forgive and Move Forward
When a partner betrays you in a relationship, it can be one of the most gut-wrenching feelings in the world. Betrayal itself can be defined as a violation of trust and it can be hard to regain faith in someone after such an event occurs. While reacting to betrayal with hurt and anger is natural, it’s important to learn how to forgive and move forward for the benefit of the relationship.
Forgiving your partner for their betrayal can feel like a daunting task. First, it’s important to recognize the feelings of hurt and betrayal, as this can help to process the emotions associated with the event. Once the painful emotions have been acknowledged, it’s time to talk to your partner. This is where the healing process can begin. Communication is key and it’s important to take responsibility for any role you may have played in the betrayal.
After the conversation has taken place, it’s important to be patient and take your time to process the emotions. Accept that it may take weeks, months - or even years - to heal from the hurt. It’s important to understand that forgiveness is a process and it’s not possible to forget what has happened overnight.
Forgiveness isn’t a declaration that what happened was ok, but it is instead an acknowledgement that the pain won’t continue to define the relationship. Moving on from the hurt involves a willingness to try to trust your partner again and to hope for a better future. It’s not easy to overcome the feeling of betrayal and it will take time and patience to move forward, but it is possible. 
Ultimately, learning how to forgive and move forward in a relationship is not only possible, but also necessary in order to keep the relationship healthy and strong. With these tips and a willingness to work through the hurt, couples can learn how to forgive and move forward after a mistake or conflict.

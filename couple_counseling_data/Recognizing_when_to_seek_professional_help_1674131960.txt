How to Recognize When You Should Seek Professional Assistance for Conflict Resolution
Couples and boyfriends/girlfriends can sometimes find themselves on the brink of a relationship breakdown due to unresolved conflicts between them. While occasional disagreements are normal and even healthy in a relationship, if one or both individuals are unable to resolve the conflict, it is important to recognize when to seek professional help in order to resolve the disagreement.
Recognizing when to seek professional help in resolving conflicts can be difficult as there is no one-size-fits-all solution to every relationship issue. However, the following signs should be considered as a red flag to help you determine if professional assistance may be necessary: 
1. If you have tried to discuss and resolve the conflict on your own and still feel stuck or have not been able to reach a resolution, it could be beneficial to seek professional help.
2. When the conflict between you and your partner is causing typical routines to be disrupted, such as difficulty sleeping, withdrawing from activities, or changes in eating habits, it may be a sign that counselling can help.
3. If the conflict is consistently leading to heated arguments, it is likely a sign of unhealthy communication or behavior patterns, and getting outside assistance can help you learn how to handle conflicts in a more respectful and productive way.
4. If one partner is repeatedly dealing with feelings of guilt or shame, they may benefit from having a third-party facilitate a constructive dialogue.
5. If the conflict has gone on for some time and one or both individuals arenâ€™t sure how to move forward, talking to a counsellor can help provide guidance and strategies for finding a solution.
Conflict resolution is a skill that must be learned, and often just talking about the problem with an unbiased person can help both parties to understand each other's point of view and find a constructive resolution. Recognizing when to seek professional help is the first step in conflict resolution and can help you and your partner to move forward in a healthy and productive manner.

Creating a Financial Roadmap: Prioritizing Expenses for Couples
When in a relationship, it is incredibly important to be honest and open with your partner about your finances. Couples must create a plan for how to manage money together, taking into account both of their financial goals and how to prioritize expenses. This is not always an easy conversation to have, but it is essential in order to ensure both parties are on the same page and can strive to reach their financial goals together.
The first step in creating a plan for financial goals is to begin with a discussion about current and future income. Talk to your partner about their wage, any other sources of income they may have and any expected changes in income (either a raise or a decrease). Together, compare the total income to total expenses, such as the cost of rent or mortgage, utilities, food, and other necessary expenses. If the total income is more than the total expenses, then this is a great starting place to begin talking about financial goals.
The next step is to prioritize expenses. Look at the needs and wants of each partner and determine what is most important. Needs are items such as rent/mortgage, food, utilities, and clothing. Wants are items such as entertainment, gifts, and vacations. It is important for both partners to come to a mutual agreement about what items should be prioritized first and to create a budget that can be followed.
When the budget is agreed upon, both partners should create a plan for how to pay bills and save money. This means that essential items like rent/mortgage and utilities should be paid first. Other bills should be set on auto-pay so that payments are never missed, and an emergency fund should be created in case of an unexpected expense. Once these things are taken care of, couples can then decide how much should be spent on wants like vacations and entertainment.
Discussing finances and creating a plan for financial goals is an important part of any relationship. Talk to your partner about your financial goals and prioritize expenses to ensure the success of both of your financial futures. Together, you can create a financial roadmap that will help you reach your financial goals as a couple.

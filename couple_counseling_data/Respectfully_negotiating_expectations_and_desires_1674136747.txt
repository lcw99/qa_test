Title: Mastering the Art of Respectful Negotiations for a Better Relationship
Subtitle: How to Be Self-Aware and Act with Consideration for Your Partner
The key to a successful relationship is understanding and respect. Respectful negotiation is a skill that can be learned and practiced to help couples navigate their relationship with understanding, compassion, and consideration for one another. As people learn to be more self-aware and mindful of their actions, it is possible to achieve a healthier, more balanced relationship for both partners. 
When starting a conversation with your partner, it is important to ensure that the atmosphere is conducive to an open and honest discussion. Consider communicating in a setting that is comfortable and without distraction; turn off the television and silence any devices. It is also important to be mindful of how you phrase your ideas and express yourself. Focus on ‘I’ statements, rather than accusatory statements like ‘you never’ or ‘you always’. This pleasant atmosphere is essential for starting a respectful conversation.
By entering into a discussion with your partner, you are attempting to negotiate the expectations and desires for the relationship. You can keep the conversation calm and collaborative by ensuring that your and your partner's boundaries are respected. For example, if both of you have a different idea of how much time you would like to spend together, you can start by listening to each other and discussing what would make you both feel most comfortable. This can help you learn about each other’s needs, and come to a compromise that respects both of your expectations.
Communication skills such as active listening can also help you and your partner to negotiate. Active listening involves repeating back what your partner has said, to show that you are listening and have understood. This helps to avoid any miscommunication, and will make sure both of you are on the same page.
When negotiating, it is important to be mindful of your partner's feelings. Respect their right to disagree with you, and try to understand their perspective. Responses like ‘I understand that you feel that way’ can help to build emotional security and make sure both of you are respected.
The key to a successful relationship is self-awareness, understanding, and compromise. As couples learn how to be more self-aware and practice respectful negotiation, it is possible to make sure that both of their expectations and desires are respected. Keeping open communication and an emotionally safe atmosphere is essential for a healthy and balanced relationship.

Title: Compromise Is Essential in Relationships
Subtitle: Using Active Listening and Constructive Problem Solving to Reach Agreements
In any relationship, communicating effectively and learning how to work through conflicts is essential to the health and longevity of the partnership. One of the most important aspects of this skill is learning to compromise with your partner. Compromise is finding an acceptable middle ground between two conflicting ideas and is a key part of resolving any half of a conflict in a relationship. 
Actively listening to your partner is an important part of communicating effectively. Being able to actively listen to your partner without judgement or criticism is the first step to any good compromise. You and your partner should both be given a chance to express and explain your views of the situation. Once both sides have been heard, the conversation can move towards finding a mutual understanding.
When trying to reach a compromise, it is important to remember to remain patient, respectful, and open to your partner’s ideas. Instead of focusing on how one of you needs to give in, try to think of ways to find a middle ground between both of your wants and needs. Constructive problem solving is key to finding an agreement. 
Finding a compromise isn’t an easy process, but it is a vital part of communication in any relationship. While it can be challenging, it is an important skill to learn and can lead to a better understanding of each other. To be successful in compromise, both partners should have an open and respectful attitude and be willing to listen to each other.

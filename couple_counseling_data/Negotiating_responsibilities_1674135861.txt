Priorities: Negotiating Responsibilities in Couple and Girlfriend/Boyfriend Relationships
In order for a couple or significant other relationship to be successful and long-lasting, both partners must be clear on the priorities in the relationship. This means each partner needs to identify and prioritize their individual goals and values, and then come together to establish a mutual understanding. Ultimately, both partners should come to a consensus about what is important to them and what responsibility each person should share. 
Having an honest, open dialogue about expectations and responsibilities can help couples and significant others to strengthen their relationship. Below are a few tips for negotiating responsibilities in relationships:
1. Make time to talk. When both partners make the effort to have open communication, they can share their thoughts and feelings, and come to an agreement about expectations and responsibilities in the relationship.
2.Be honest. Honesty is a key factor in any successful relationship. Partners should be honest with each other about their expectations and needs in order to negotiate responsibilities in a productive and healthy way.
3. Respect each other's priorities. Each partner should respect the other's priorities, even if they differ. This doesn't mean one partner has to agree with the other, it simply means that each partner should respect the other's wishes and honor their goals and values.
4.Be willing to compromise. Both partners should be willing to compromise and make concessions in order to come to an agreement about the responsibilities in the relationship.
By following these tips, couples and significant others can negotiate responsibilities in a productive and healthy way. When both partners are on the same page about their goals and values, and understand each otherâ€™s responsibilities, the relationship can become much more fulfilling and rewarding.

Title: Planning for the Future: Establishing a Timeline for Major Life Events in a Relationship 
No matter how strong a relationship is, the future of that relationship is filled with unknowns. One way couples can work together to shape the future of their relationship is to create a timeline for major life events. This process of goal-setting in a relationship allows a couple to discuss their hopes and plans for the future, and make decisions together about how to achieve their larger objectives.
When it comes to planning for major life events, there are a few key considerations for couples. First, couples should think through the timeline on which they would like to pursue their goals. Depending on what their goals are and the timeline they have in mind, they may need to think through certain details, such as the age of their children, their ideal job positions, the type of home they would like to live in, and where they would like to be financially. 
The second thing couples should consider when creating a timeline for major life events is what resources they will need to meet their goals. This could include financial resources, career resources, and even family resources. This is an important step as it will help to inform the goals that the couple can reasonably expect to achieve within the timeline they have set.
Once all of the details are worked out, it's important for the couple to put their timeline into action. This means discussing their goals in further detail, and establishing a plan for how they will work together to achieve their goals. They should also create a timeline for check-ins, to review how they are progressing towards each of their goals. This will allow the couple to adjust their timeline and plans as needed, and make sure that each partner is doing their part to achieve their goals. 
Creating a timeline for major life events in a relationship is an important step for couples to take in their journey together. Not only does it help to ensure that both partners are on the same page about their plans, but it also creates an opportunity for the couple to work together to achieve their goals. By setting goals and creating a timeline, couples can ensure they are on track to build the future they hope for together.

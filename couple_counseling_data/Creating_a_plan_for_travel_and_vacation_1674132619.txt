How to Plan Travel and Vacation Goals to Strengthen Your Relationship 
Relationships are made up of different elements that can help increase the happiness, communication, and understanding of a couple around each other. One key factor that often gets neglected is setting goals and creating plans for the future. This is especially true in terms of travel and vacation. Setting travel and vacation goals is an important part of deepening the relationship, helping you both understand each other's desires for the future and how to work together to achieve these goals. 
The first step to setting travel and vacation goals is to discuss where both of you would like to go and what types of activities you would like to do. It helps to create a list of places each of you would like to go and activities that you think would be fun. Once this list is complete, it’s time to discuss what both of you would like to accomplish. Ask each other questions about why each destination is important to you and what are the dreams and desires each of you has for that destination. This will provide you with insight into each other’s interests and help you create a plan that is tailored to both of your desires. 
Once you have a plan, the next step is to create a budget. Discuss how much time and money each of you would be willing to invest in the trip. This will help you determine which destinations and activities can realistically be achieved in the timeframe you have set. It is important to be honest and realistic in your budgeting. Don’t make plans that are beyond your means as this can lead to frustration and disappointment. 
The final step is to create a timeline for when each part of the trip will be accomplished. Make sure to include a timeline for making the reservations, packing, and preparing for the trip. This will help ensure that each of you is on the same page and can plan accordingly. 
Setting travel and vacation goals can be a wonderful way to strengthen your relationship. Not only does it give you a chance to learn about each other, but it also provides a strong foundation for future plans and decisions in the relationship. By following the steps outlined above, you will be sure to create a plan that will bring the two of you closer together.

Setting Goals and Clarifying Expectations in Relationships: Achieving Relationship Satisfaction
When a couple gets together, challenges arise as the two individuals attempt to balance individual needs and expectations with what they desire in the relationship. To navigate these difficulties, couples need to understand each other’s goals and expectations, while also setting goals together. This can be done by having deep and meaningful conversations about one’s aspirations and hopes for the relationship. 
When discussing goals and expectations, each partner in the relationship should strive to be as clear and honest as possible about their wishes. It is important to talk about how each goal will be achieved, and which activities or adjustments may be necessary to bring both partners closer to reaching those goals. Doing this can help couples identify areas in which one partner may be hesitant but willing to compromise, as well as areas in which both partners can work together to bring about results that benefit the relationship. Doing this will help couples create a sense of unity and collaboration - elements that are essential to maintaining a healthy, happy relationship. 
It is important to remember that each individual’s goals and expectations should be respected. While it is okay to express one’s own expectations, it is also important to acknowledge and accept that the other person’s desires and expectations may differ. By discussing and understanding each other’s needs, couples can learn to compromise and find solutions that work best for the relationship. By clarifying expectations and setting goals together, couples can learn to work together to create a strong foundation and mutual understanding that will bring them closer together and improve the overall satisfaction within the relationship.

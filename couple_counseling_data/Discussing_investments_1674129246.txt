How to Talk About Investments with Your Partner
Making the Most of Couples' Financial Goals
Money can be a tricky topic to tackle in any relationship. Even more so when it comes to discussing investments. A couple’s financial assets and investment portfolios may not readily coincide. But investing together can help both partners achieve their respective financial goals. Here are a few tips to help couples have a productive and positive discussion on investments:
1. Talk early and often: When it comes to investing and money, there should never be any surprises. Make sure both partners are regularly talking about their respective investment goals and portfolios. This doesn’t mean you’re obligated to tell each other every move you make, but being open about your plans and strategies overall is essential.
2. Set clear goals: A great way to begin conversations about investments is by setting some mutual financial goals. Do you want to save for retirement? Are you looking to buy a house soon? Maybe you’re aiming to invest in a business. Sit down with your partner and decide on some overarching objectives, and then figure out which investments might help you reach those milestones.
3. Respect each other’s preferences: Having different investment styles isn’t necessarily a bad thing, even if it feels like you’re poles apart. Work together to find a common ground, and recognize that your partner may have a valid perspective that could benefit your joint financial strategy.
4. Invest for the long haul: Investing for the short term can be tempting, but it likely won’t pay off in the long run. Picking solid investments with long-term horizons is often the most prudent strategy.
Ultimately, discussing investments with your partner should be a regular part of your relationship. Doing so will help both of you stay on track for achieving your respective financial goals. And as with anything related to finances, it’s important to make sure your decisions are data-driven and well-informed. Research your options and consult a professional if necessary. The more you know, the better equipped you’ll be to make smart investments as a couple.

Title: Forgiveness in Relationships: adressing Conflict with a Plan 
When couples experience conflicts, it can be difficult to forgive and move forward. Learning how to forgive and move forward in the aftermath of a mistake or disagreement is essential to having a healthy relationship. It is equally important to create a plan to prevent this type of disagreement from occurring in the future.
Research indicates that forgiveness is beneficial to relationships, as it can provide physical, mental, and emotional well-being for both partners. In order to achieve true forgiveness, couples must learn to recognize and accept their partner's mistake and take ownership of their role in the disagreement. This often includes apologizing and discussing the disagreement in a constructive, respectful way.
When it comes to preventing future disagreements, couples may want to develop a plan for how to best address their individual needs. Healthy communication is keyâ€”expressing needs in a non-judgmental and respectful way can help both parties feel heard and understood. Practicing empathy and trying to see the situation from your partner's perspective is also important. Setting aside time to have meaningful conversations can help couples better understand each other and create an environment of understanding and acceptance.
Couples should also discuss ways to de-escalate any potential arguments that might arise. If a disagreement does arise, couples should be mindful of their body language and tone of voice, attempting to remain respectful to one another at all times. Agreeing on a few basic rules, such as taking a break before discussing a heated argument, can help couples navigate these disagreements with more ease.
Learning how to forgive and move forward in the aftermath of a disagreement is essential to the health of any relationship. Creating a plan for addressing future disagreements can help both partners come to a resolution and better understand each other. With a combination of understanding, respect, and communication, couples can work to maintain a healthy relationship.

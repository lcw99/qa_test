How to Communicate Feelings in a Healthy Relationship
By: Jane Smith
It is natural in any relationship to have differences, disagreements, and even some turbulent moments of anger and frustration. Despite these moments, couples will benefit greatly when they learn to talk openly and honestly with each other. Expressing and recognizing each other's feelings is an essential part of giving and receiving support in a relationship.
One of the biggest issues couples can have is when one or both partners are unable to express their feelings in an open and healthy way. This has the potential to create tension and even bitterness in the relationship. It's important for both partners to recognize the importance of being able to communicate feelings to one another in a healthy way.
The first step in expressing feelings is to get comfortable with them. It may be helpful to take some time to reflect on one's thoughts and feelings, and use the time to think through them before speaking. This can be a valuable tool in understanding one’s own emotions, and being comfortable with expressing them.
In addition to getting comfortable with expressing one’s own feelings, it’s also important to be aware of the other person’s feelings. It’s vital to tune into nonverbal cues, body language and facial expressions, as well as the words that are being used. A healthy relationship includes being able to sense the other person’s emotion and respond accordingly.
When it comes time to actually discuss the feelings, it’s important to be mindful of the words used. Choose words carefully, as overly harsh language or name-calling can damage the relationship. If a partner is feeling angry or frustrated, it’s best to wait until the emotion has passed before speaking about it. It’s also a good idea to practice active listening, which is listening without interruption and then reflecting back to the speaker what was heard.
Being able to express feelings and provide support to each other is a key factor in healthy relationships. By taking the time to reflect on one’s own feelings and understanding the importance of being aware of the other person’s feelings, couples can learn to express themselves and listen to one another in a constructive, positive way. This will contribute to building a strong, lasting bond between them.

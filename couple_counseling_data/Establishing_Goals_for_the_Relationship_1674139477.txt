Establishing Goals for the Relationship: Setting a Mutual Path for Success
By: [Author Name]
In any committed relationship, it can be beneficial for both individuals to establish a set of goals that they wish to achieve as a couple. This may include short-term goals such as taking a vacation together, or longer-term goals like buying a house or starting a family. Having a set of clearly defined goals gives both individuals direction and purpose in their relationship, creating a plan of action and raising the likelihood of success.
The first step in establishing relationship goals is to discuss these objectives with one another. This can be done in a natural setting such as on a walk together, or it may be helpful to plan a dedicated time together to have an open and honest discussion about your hopes and dreams for the future. The important thing is to be open and honest with each other, ensuring that both of your ideas and expectations are fully taken into account. 
It can also be valuable to be realistic about what can be achieved. Knowing your limits and avoiding setting goals that are not achievable can help keep couples from becoming frustrated or feeling inadequate. Consider what the two of you can reasonably expect to achieve in the short-term and the long-term. A good example would be to aim to take a weekend away together next summer, rather than attempting to buy a house by the end of the year.
It is equally important to create check-in points to review and assess the goals that have been set. Setting reminders to review the goals, such as marking the midpoint in the year, can help ensure that progress is being made and that the goals are still relevant to both of you. 
Establishing goals in a relationship can be a great way to stay connected, allowing both individuals to feel supported, motivated, and inspired. By creating and following a mutual plan of action, couples can help ensure that their relationship is on a path of success and achievement.

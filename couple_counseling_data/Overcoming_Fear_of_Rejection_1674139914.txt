Title: Overcoming Fear of Rejection in Relationships: Building Self-Esteem Together 
Nobody likes feeling rejected, especially in a relationship. Fear of being rejected is often a symptom of low self-esteem. In order to build healthy and lasting relationships, it can be helpful to work together to improve both partners' self-esteem.
Self-Esteem Through Acceptance
The first step to overcoming fear of rejection is to accept your partner exactly as they are. When you accept your partner’s flaws, strengths, and quirks, you will start to appreciate them in a more meaningful way; this kind of acceptance can help to boost self-esteem. When both partners are aware of each other’s strengths and weaknesses, they can support each other and build each other up.
Support Your Partner
A lack of self-esteem can lead to feelings of insecurity. By showing your partner that you support them no matter what, they will start to feel more secure and valued. Making time to listen to your partner talk about their doubts, fears and accomplishments can help them to increase their self-esteem. Even the little things like telling your partner “I believe in you” or “I trust you” can help to build self-esteem and make them feel appreciated.
Encourage Self-Improvement
Sometimes it can be difficult for someone to work on improving their self-esteem if they don’t feel supported. As a partner, it is important to encourage your significant other to take on activities and challenges that will help them to feel more confident and competent in their day-to-day life. For example, if they’ve been wanting to learn a new skill, encourage them to take a class or read a book and while they are working on it, show them your full support.
Take Breaks
Sometimes fear of rejection can be a sign that you or your partner is feeling overwhelmed. Taking breaks regularly can help to reduce stress and improve mental health, which will in turn help to improve self-esteem. Make sure to create time for yourself and your partner to relax and enjoy a break. This might be a couple’s weekend getaway, a night out to the movies, or simply some time spent cuddling on the couch. 
Partners can play a major role in helping each other to build and maintain self-esteem. By having open, honest conversations about fears and insecurities and taking time to appreciate one another can be key to developing and maintaining a healthy, strong relationship. Remember to always practice self-care and express your gratitude for your partner.

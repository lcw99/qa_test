Title: Understanding Body Language for Stronger Couples Relationships 
Subtitle: How Developing Active Listening Skills Can Help Strengthen Your Interactions
Couples often need more than just verbal communication to feel connected and understood. Being able to understand body language can play a big part in providing this connection and increasing intimacy. Body language is a form of non-verbal communication that speaks much louder than words. By developing active listening skills, couples can learn to decipher the unspoken messages that come through their partner's body language and gain a better understanding of one another.
The first step in understanding body language is to assess the environment. Pay attention to the space between you and your partner, the tone of their voice, and the expressions they make. All of these small cues can provide clues as to how your partner is feeling in the moment. For example, if your partner is standing far away from you and speaking in a low tone, they may be feeling apprehensive or anxious. 
Aside from assessing the immediate environment, there are certain movements that are universal in understanding body language. Crossed arms are a sign of defensiveness, while leaning in and making eye contact usually indicate interest. Pay attention to your partner's facial expressions and the way they move their hands and perform gestures, as these are all signs of their views and underlying emotions. 
Your partner's body language can reveal more information about how they are feeling in the moment. Developing active listening skills gives you the opportunity to ask questions about their body language and learn how your behavior may be affecting them. It is also important to be mindful of your own body language and take note of how your movements may be interpreted. As humans, we are naturally very intuitive and can often recognize body language for what it is.
Understanding body language is a great way to deepen your connection as a couple and bridge communication gaps. By developing active listening skills, couples can better understand each other's feelings and connect through body language. Improved communication can lead to increased intimacy and understanding, while also giving couples the opportunity to open up and connect on a deeper level.

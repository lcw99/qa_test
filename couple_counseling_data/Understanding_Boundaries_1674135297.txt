Understand Boundaries in Couples and Girlfriend/Boyfriend Relationships
By Martha Jones
When it comes to relationships, being able to understand boundaries is key. Having an open dialogue about values and boundaries can help ensure that both partners feel respected, understood, and safe in the relationship. 
Every relationship is unique and so not every individual's values will be the same. While it's important to be respectful of your partner's values and boundaries, it's also important for each person in the relationship to be comfortable speaking up and setting boundaries. 
In order to discuss values, both individuals should have an understanding of what their own values are. This might include things like communication, loyalty, trust, respect, and commitment. Once both individuals know what their values are, they can begin to discuss how these values interact with one another and how each partner can support the other. This should include an open dialogue where each partner can express what their needs are and come to a mutual agreement on how these needs will be met.
It is also important to make sure that each individual respects the boundaries that their partner sets. For example, if one person has a value of spending time alone, they should honor that need and make sure that they are not encroaching on the other person's space. Similarly, if one person has a value of open communication, it is important for both partners to make sure they are communicating their needs and that the other person is actively listening.
Ultimately, understanding values and boundaries can be a key component to making sure that a relationship is healthy and fulfilling for both partners. Respect, understanding, and communication should be the foundation of any successful relationship, and making sure to have an open dialogue about what is acceptable and desirable behavior from both individuals is the best way to ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Learning to Manage Stress and Caring for Yourself During Difficulties
The nature of relationships can involve dealing with difficult situations, disagreements and emotional turmoil. Even in the most loving, supportive relationships, couples may unfortunately experience conflict. While navigating and resolving relationship conflicts can bring couples closer, it is also a process that can be draining and, in extreme cases, unhealthy. That’s why it is important, even during the worst of times, to prioritize self-care.
Violent or extreme behavior should not be tolerated, and the safest option is to leave any volatile situation. But, even when conflicts or disagreements don’t reach that level, it is important to remember self-care. Self-care is an act of kindness and respect towards yourself, and it’s important to make sure that you are taking care of your physical and emotional needs even in the midst of a conflict.
The first step towards prioritizing self-care is to recognize the situation for what it is: a difficult moment in your relationship. Acknowledge that this moment is temporary, and try to take a step back from the situation to get some perspective. This helps to create a space where the feelings from the situation can be managed, and the conflict discussed in a chilled and rational manner.
Speaking calmly and objectively helps to normalize the conversation and de-escalates the situation. It is important to avoid heated exchanges as much as possible, as these will not just take away from the resolution process, but also has the potential to lead to further mistrust and hurt. Whenever possible, it is better to take some time to process your reactions, and come back to the table with a clear, composed head.
When it is not possible to step away, it helps to identify the emotions that are coming up and focus on your breathing. This helps to keep things in perspective and become mindful of the sensations and feelings in the moment, so that it is not just a reaction but something that is consciously chosen. Prioritizing self-care can also mean actively avoiding engaging in conflicts until emotions have had time to settle.
This does not mean that harm should be done in the relationship, but rather that it is better to avoid the situation until you have had the time to recharge and to think of a resolution from a more thoughtful, calm perspective. All of this requires a level of self-awareness and the ability to recognize when you need to take care of yourself.
Self-care is important for any relationship, regardless of how difficult the situation is. Taking the time to prioritize self-care helps to manage stress, which ultimately helps relationships to stay healthy. This can be as simple as taking a break, going for a walk or just creating some space between yourself and the situation.
It is not a sign of weakness to prioritize self-care during difficult moments, but a sign of strength and respect. Taking care of yourself during a conflict is a way to honour yourself and your relationship, and move closer to a healthy, long-term resolution.

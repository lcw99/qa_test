Title: Overcoming Barriers to Listening in Relationships: Understanding the importance of deeper connection 
In relationships we often focus on what we want to say and forget the importance of really hearing each other. Listening to our partner is essential in developing a strong connection and deeper understanding. Sadly, however, many couples find it difficult to truly listen, let alone understand each other. All too often, we come to relationships with preconceived ideas, or with a wall up, not allowing ourselves to really hear the other. If we can identify the barriers to active listening and work to break them down, we can truly unlock the potential of our relationships.
The first barrier to active listening is our own expectations. We assume what we think the other person is saying, based on our own experience or perspective. This is often a recipe for disaster, as it can lead to pre-judgements and misunderstandings. Letting go of our pre-conceived ideas and being open to hearing the other person is key. To prevent our expectations from getting in the way, we need to practice mindfulness and stay in the present moment.
Another barrier we must overcome is our own fear. We fear that what the other has to say may challenge our beliefs or values. When this happens, we automatically put up a shield and don’t allow ourselves to truly understand their perspective. To combat this, it’s important to accept that we won’t always agree, but that it’s okay; it’s part of any relationship. By allowing our partner to express their views without judgement, we can really open up the channels of communication.
Finally, many of us have difficulty communicating our own wants and needs. If we don’t vocalize how we feel, our partner won’t be able to understand what’s going on. Our feelings can be hard to share and we may be afraid our partner won’t understand, but having that open dialogue is an important part of active listening.
By addressing these barriers, we can start to understand the importance of listening to each other. Active listening allows us to go beyond our regular interactions and really connect. Doing so can be the key to unlocking a deeper understanding and connection within our relationships.

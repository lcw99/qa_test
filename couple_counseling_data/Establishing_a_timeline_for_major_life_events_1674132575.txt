Setting Goals and Establishing a Timeline for Major Life Events in Relationships
In a successful relationship, couples should take the time to discuss their goals in order to gain a better understanding of each other and to establish a shared vision of the future. This dialogue allows partners to create mutual expectations and encourages them to take steps towards achieving those goals. One important area of goal setting and planning involves establishing a timeline for major life events such as marriage, children, career moves, and travel. 
It is important to have honest conversations with your partner about when each of you expects to complete different life events. It may be helpful to start by discussing your individual goals and then to move on to outlining the goals and timeline of your relationship. For example, if one partner wants to have children in the next few years and the other wants to wait several more years, a compromise should be struck that satisfies both parties. 
It may be helpful to break down large life events into smaller goals and objectives. For example, if you both plan to get married, decide on a timeline for when you want to start looking for rings, when you want to book a venue, and so on. If you both want to move for a new job opportunity, decide when you both want to start looking for jobs, when you want to give notice to your current employer, and when you want to move. 
Having honest conversations about goals and timelines can help establish a road map for your future together and strengthen your relationship. Itâ€™s important to discuss these topics openly and to be open to compromise if you and your partner have different expectations. Setting goals and establishing a timeline can help you both stay focused and motivated as you work towards a shared future.

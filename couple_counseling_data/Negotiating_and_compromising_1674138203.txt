The Path to Relationship Reconciliation: Negotiating and Compromising to Forgive and Move On
By Stephanie Harper
Making mistakes and having disagreements are a part of most relationships, but learning how to move forward after a conflict or mistake is a skill that must be developed. The ability to forgive and move on is essential in any successful relationship. One of the best ways to get back on track and rekindle a relationship is to practice negotiating and compromising.
Negotiating is the process of determining a mutually beneficial agreement in which both people can reach a compromise. Successful negotiation usually involves a willingness to compromise as well as an understanding of the other person’s point of view. Before beginning to negotiate, think about what you want and what you are willing to give in order to get it. It’s important to keep an open mind and to be willing to make some concessions in order to come to a resolution that both parties are happy with.
During the negotiation process, be sure to listen carefully to what the other person is saying. Try to understand their perspective, and be sure to communicate your own point of view. Avoid getting defensive or attacking the other person. Instead, focus on finding a solution that works for both of you.
Compromising is an important part of the negotiation process. This means both people will be required to give up something in order to find a compromise that works for both. It can be difficult to give up something you want, but it is essential if you want to move forward.
When it comes to forgiving and moving on, it can be difficult to find a balance between being understanding and showing generosity. Be sure to communicate your feelings and recognize that the other person may have different feelings than you. Recognizing and understanding that the other person’s feelings are valid and real is an important part of forgiveness and moving forward.
Negotiating and compromising can be difficult, but in the end, it is essential in coming to an agreement that works for both people involved. It can be difficult to let go of anger and hurt feelings, but it is important to remember that it is possible to find a resolution that works for everyone. Negotiating and compromising are key elements of learning how to forgive and move forward after a mistake or conflict.

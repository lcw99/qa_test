Title: Achieving Relationship Goals: The Benefits of Setting Short-term and Long-term Goals
Couples and boyfriend/girlfriend relationships should take some time to talk about the goals they have for the future of their relationship. Setting goals and making a plan to achieve them can be a beneficial process for both sides of the relationship, allowing each partner to recognize their individual desires and develop a process for meeting their combined goals. But when it comes to relationship goals, it’s important to know the difference between short-term and long-term goals and to know how to achieve each.
Short-term Goals
Short-term goals are those that are achievable in the immediate future—within a few weeks or months. These goals usually involve smaller, attainable targets that provide progress towards a larger goal. Examples of short-term goals a couple may set for themselves could include: 
• Defining/discussing a shared vision for the future of the relationship
• Spending quality time together each week
• Identifying and resolving any underlying issues
• Identifying and expressing individual needs
Achieving short-term goals can be done through communication and honest dialogue. Couples should discuss their goals in depth to ensure both parties are on the same page and have a shared understanding of what they’re hoping to achieve. Setting short-term goals can provide an immediate sense of accomplishment, which can help motivate the couple to remain focused and strive towards their ultimate long-term goals.
Long-term Goals
Long-term goals are those that take more time to achieve, usually over the course of several months or years. Long-term goals are often larger and more complex than short-term goals and are typically focused on the legacy of the relationship. Examples of long-term goals a couple may set for themselves could include: 
• Reaching a deeper level of trust and understanding
• Creating a sustainable plan for the relationship
• Developing healthy communication habits
• Defining personal and shared goals
Unlike short-term goals, long-term goals require more planning and forethought in order to be achieved. Couples should take their time in discussing the details of their long-term goals and determine the best approach for achieving them over the course of their relationship. Working together to achieve long-term goals can be both rewarding and empowering for couples, and can help them remain focused on their shared vision for the future.
Setting goals for a relationship can be a beneficial process for both parties, allowing them to recognize their individual desires and develop a plan for meeting their shared objectives. Couples should understand the difference between short-term and long-term goals and be committed to achieving them through honest communication and collaboration. By setting both short-term and long-term goals, couples can build a strong foundation for a successful, long-lasting relationship.

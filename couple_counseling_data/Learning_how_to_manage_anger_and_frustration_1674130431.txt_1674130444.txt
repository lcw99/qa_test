Title: Managing Anger in Conflict Resolution: 5 Strategies for Couples 
Conflict and disagreements are inevitable in a romantic relationship. While it’s natural for couples to experience frustration and become angry with each other, it’s important to find healthy and effective ways to manage anger so that couples can resolve their conflicts in a productive and positive way. Here are five strategies for couples to manage anger and frustration in conflict resolution.
1. Take Time Apart 
It’s natural for couples to need some time and space apart from each other in the midst of a disagreement or conflict. When anger starts to rise, taking a brief timeout is a healthy way to allow both partners to cool off and process their feelings in a calm and composed way. It’s important to avoid acting on an impulse out of anger, so by taking a few moments apart, couples can come back together with a clear head and a better sense of perspective.
2. Acknowledge and Validate Feelings 
When tensions are high in a disagreement, it’s important to take a moment to recognize and validate each other’s feelings. It can be helpful to share with each other how the other person is feeling and why, explaining the underlying emotions. Doing so takes the focus away from the argument at hand and helps to create a more understanding and compassionate environment.
3. Listen to Each Other 
Another key component in managing anger is actively listening to each other. It’s easy to get caught up in the moment and forget to pause and actually be present and listen to the other person. But actively listening can help to de-escalate the situation as both partners come to understand the other’s perspective and feelings. 
4. Identify and Discuss Solutions 
Once the tension has cooled down and both partners have taken the time to listen to each other, it’s important to move forward by identifying solutions together. Having a productive dialogue with each other can help to create solutions that both sides can agree on and support. 
5. Follow Through on Agreements 
Finally, it’s essential to follow through on any agreements that were made during the conflict. This helps to create trust and shows that both partners are invested in the process of resolving conflict in a healthy way. Couples should be sure to check-in with each other periodically to make sure that both parties are upholding their end of the agreement.
Learning to manage anger and frustration in conflict resolution is an important skill for couples to develop in order to maintain a healthy and strong relationship. By taking time apart, listening to each other, acknowledging and validating feelings, identifying solutions, and following through on agreements, couples can learn to effectively manage their anger and work towards a positive resolution.

Expressing Gratitude: A Necessary Ingredient for Emotional Support in a Relationship
It is sometimes difficult for people to understand the importance of emotional support in relationships. However, making the effort to express gratitude for a partner and their contributions to the relationship is essential for providing support. Taking a few moments to recognize the things that a partner does for the relationship can be incredibly beneficial in cultivating a sense of mutual respect, love, and emotional understanding between partners.
Gratitude can be expressed in a variety of ways, from meaningful conversations and thoughtful gestures to small but meaningful tokens of appreciation. Here are some tactics to help cultivate an attitude of gratitude in a relationship:
• Make a point to thank your partner for the little things they do. It can be easy to overlook the smaller acts of kindness that your partner does for the relationship, since it may seem not as impactful or significant as the bigger, more noticeable gestures. But even small things such as bringing you coffee in the morning or helping with laundry can be meaningful and should be acknowledged. 
• Take the time to express gratitude during conflict. It might feel counterintuitive to do this, since it’s easier to forget the small acts of kindness when disagreements arise. However, it’s important to take time to appreciate the efforts of your partner when the going gets rough. Acknowledging the work your partner puts into making the relationship work can remind both of you of the importance of continuing to put effort into the relationship.
• Exchange gratitude through written words. Writing down what you appreciate about your partner can be a great way to express your gratitude in a tangible way. Writing a letter to your partner or leaving a note for them to find can be incredibly meaningful, particularly if you’re not able to express your gratitude verbally.
Expressing gratitude for a partner is an important part of achieving emotional support in a relationship. By acknowledging your partner's contributions, you create a climate of mutual respect, appreciation and understanding. Although it may seem like a small gesture, it can have a big impact on the strength of your relationship.

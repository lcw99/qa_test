How to Discuss Expectations with Your Partner: A Guide for Couples
It is common for couples to struggle with understanding each other’s expectations for their relationship. This is often due to not having a clear understanding of each other’s priorities, values and goals. Having an open and honest conversation about expectations can be a beneficial tool for a couple to get on the same page, while also improving their relationship. 
When it comes to discussing expectations with your partner, it is important to remember that a couple’s expectations can often differ based on individual perspectives. To ensure that the conversation is productive, couples should strive to focus on mutual understanding and respect. It is also important to prioritize communication and practice active listening skills.
The best way to approach discussing expectations with your partner is to first set aside a reasonable amount of time to have the conversation. It is important to be in a comfortable environment and to ensure that there are no distractions or outside influences.
The conversation should begin with each partner sharing their individual goals and values for the relationship. This can include topics such as trust, communication, intimacy and respect. Once goals and values have been identified, couples should discuss reasonable expectations that come with each. This can involve discussing topics such as expectations for commitment, time spent together, communication frequency and resolution of conflicts.
Once individual goals, values and expectations have been discussed, couples can discuss common expectations for the relationship. This is an important step for creating a mutually beneficial relationship with one another.
Discussing expectations with your partner can be a difficult conversation to have, but it is an important step for identifying and prioritizing goals and values in the relationship. With proper communication skills and an open mind, couples can benefit from having an honest and productive conversation.

By: ________________
It can be difficult to find the courage to take risks in any relationship, whether it be with a romantic partner, a close friend, or even a family member. Taking a risk means that you might fail and this can be intimidating. However, taking risks can help to build self-esteem in your relationship in the long run. 
Being able to take risks with your partner and not be afraid of failure is one of the most important tasks of any relationship. Learning to take risks with your partner will not only help to strengthen the bond between the two of you, but it can also help to build your own self-esteem and help you to become more confident overall. 
There are many ways to start taking risks in a relationship and it starts by being honest and open with your partner. When you have open communication, you are able to communicate your needs and desires more effectively, which will make it easier for you to start taking risks. 
It's also important to remember that risks don't have to be big and bold. Taking small risks on a regular basis is a good way to start. For example, perhaps you could suggest a new restaurant that you've been wanting to try, or a new movie you've been wanting to watch. Small, everyday risks such as this can add up to make a big difference in your relationship.
It's also important to remember that when you take a risk, there's always a chance of failure. This can be daunting, but it's important to keep in mind that failure is a part of life, and it's important to learn how to handle it appropriately. Your partner can be helpful in this regard, as they can offer support and help you to work through any issues or challenges that may arise.
In conclusion, taking risks can help to build self-esteem in your relationship. It's important to start small and to openly communicate with your partner. Remember that failure is a part of life, and when it does happen it's important to learn from it and to use it to build stronger relationships in the future.

Title: The Power of Compromise: Identifying and Negotiating Common Relationship Differences
When entering into a relationship, couples must learn how to effectively communicate, share, and compromise with each other. The ability to successfully resolve your issues is a major factor in the success of a relationship and understanding the various types of compromise can help couples effectively negotiate differences.
Comprehensive Compromise
Comprehensive compromise is when both partners agree to a solution that allows both to have some of their needs met. Talk together and brainstorm solutions that both of you can accept. This kind of compromise is often the most successful because both parties have given up some of what they want and accepted a compromise that meets both of your needs.
Relinquish Compromise
Relinquish compromise occurs when one person makes a concession completely, meaning that person needs to give up what they want completely for the other person to get what they need. This kind of compromise often happens when there is an imbalance of power in the relationship, and it should be carefully considered before accepting.
Split Compromise
Split compromise is when both parties agree to accept a solution that meets both of their needs, but not completely. Both parties will give up some of what they want to reach a solution that is acceptable to both. This is typically the easiest type of compromise to reach because you are both making some concessions.
Compromising Negotiation
Compromising negotiation occurs when both sides are willing to negotiate and be flexible. This is usually the most effective way to resolve differences, as both parties can discuss their needs and create solutions that meet them both.
Negotiated Compromise
Negotiated compromise happens when one person agrees to give up what they want, while the other person agrees to meet some of their needs. This form of compromise is often the most fair and allows both parties to get what they need, while still giving the other person the result they desire.
In sum, understanding the different types of compromise can help couples effectively negotiate differences. Compromising negotiation is typically the most successful form of compromise as both parties can come to a resolution that meets their needs. Ultimately, compromising can require both parties to give up what they want, but it also allows for mutual resolution and can strengthen a relationship by increasing understanding and trust.

Creating a Financial Plan as a Couple: Determining Who Pays for What
Having an open and honest discussion about your finances is an especially important part of being in a committed relationship, especially when it comes to determining who pays for what. To ensure everyone is on the same page, it is essential to discuss and agree on a budget that works for both of you. 
The most important aspect of determining who will pay for what is understanding what your financial goals are as a couple. It is important to discuss both of your individual goals, such as a savings plan, and your combined goals, such as owning a home. Asking yourselves questions such as "What are our highest priorities for our money?" and "What kind of financial security do we both want to have in the future?" will help you to create a plan that both of you are comfortable with.
Once you have determined your overall financial goals, you can then proceed to decide how you will divide the responsibility for paying for different things. Many couples choose to split the expenses down the middle or agree to share the cost of certain items. Alternatively, couples may decide that one person will pay for certain items and the other person will pay for other items. Whichever way you decide to structure it, make sure that you are both comfortable with the arrangement and that both of your needs are being balanced and fulfilled. 
Creating a financial plan together can be intimidating and even lead to some tension. To make sure you both have a good experience, it is important to approach the discussion with respect and patience. After all, it is about understanding each otherâ€™s wants and needs so that you can work together to create a financial plan that takes care of both of you.

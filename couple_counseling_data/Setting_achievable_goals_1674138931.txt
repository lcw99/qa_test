Setting Achievable Goals: The Key to Mutual Emotional Support in Relationships
By ____ 
Providing emotional support to your significant other is a critical component of any successful relationship. Couples must be able to depend on each other to share feelings, thoughts, and ideas, and come to agreements. One way to build a foundation of mutual support is to create achievable goals together.
By discussing and creating achievable goals, couples can nurture and strengthen their bond. Having achievable goals gives both members of a couple something to strive for, and provides a sense of motivation and focus. It also gives them a chance to collaborate, brainstorm, and plan for the future.
Achievable goals can be anything from starting a business together, to learning a new skill, to contributing to a charity. The important part is to make sure the goals are realistic and specific. For example, a goal of “starting a business” is too vague and can become overwhelming. But a goal of “starting a business by the end of the year” is achievable, and can be broken down into smaller, more attainable milestones.
By setting achievable goals, couples can provide each other with the emotional support they need to strive for a shared future. Both members of the couple have something to aim for, and they have each other to share the work, the ups and downs, and the successes. In this way, setting achievable goals can be a source of strength and encouragement for a relationship.
Couples should never forget the importance of emotional support in any relationship. By setting achievable goals, couples can create a bond of mutual support that will last a lifetime.

Celebrating Differences: How to Embrace Value Discrepancies in Couples and Girlfriend/Boyfriend Relationships
A key part of any successful relationship is acceptance and understanding for your partner’s values, regardless of how different these may be from your own. However, it can be difficult to remain open and respectful when discussing values and learning to deal with the potential disagreements that may arise. Here are some tips to help you celebrate differences, strengthen your relationship and make sure all voices are heard. 
1. Acknowledge that you have different values. Acknowledging and understanding that you and your partner have different values and perspectives can be a great first step in strengthening your bond and becoming more respectful of each other. When discussing values, it is important to reflect on and celebrate the unique perspectives that you both bring to the relationship. 
2. Listen to each other and remain open-minded. It can be difficult to remain open-minded when discussing values, especially when you disagree strongly with your partner’s perspective. It is important to remember to listen to each other, understand the other’s point of view and be willing to compromise. 
3. Focus on the positives. When talking about values, it can be easy to become contentious. Instead of focusing on the negatives of the disagreement, try to focus on the positives in the relationship. Celebrate the fact that you are learning more about each other and the differences that make you unique. 
4. Give yourself space when needed. It is normal to need a break every now and then in order to process your emotions and feelings. If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed during the discussion, it is ok to give yourself a break. 
Determining and understanding each other’s values is an important part of any relationship. A strong bond is built when both partners can appreciate their differences and remain open-minded. With the right attitude, celebrating value discrepancies in couples and girlfriend/boyfriend relationships can be a great way to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation for each other.

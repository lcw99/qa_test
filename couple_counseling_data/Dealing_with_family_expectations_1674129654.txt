When a relationship is young and flourishing, it can be easy to forget about the family dynamics that are at play. As a couple, you and your partner may have come to an agreement about how to deal with their family or yours, but no one can prepare you for the expectations or opinions that come with the family unit. No matter how well-prepared you think you are, suddenly being confronted with the family wants or needs can be an intimidating experience. 
When it comes to dealing with family expectations, it’s important to remember that no matter how difficult it can be, at the end of the day, your happiness with your partner is the most important. Consider these tips when navigating the role of family in a relationship. 
1. Communicate openly and honestly. Be sure to talk to your partner about their family’s expectations and let them know your thoughts and feelings in a respectful and understanding way. If you and your partner can come to an agreement about how to handle the dynamics between the two of you, it can make it much easier to work your way through it.
2. Be respectful. Even if you and your partner disagree on how to handle a certain family dynamic, it’s important that you take the other person’s feelings into consideration. Try not to be dismissive or combative, and instead, try to show understanding and compassion.
3. Establish boundaries. Family dynamics can easily become destructive if you and your partner don’t set boundaries. Respect your own wishes and don’t let anyone in your partner’s family dictate what you should do or expect from you. 
4. Seek help if necessary. If the family dynamics start to affect your relationship or your mental health, it’s important that you reach out and get help. Talk to your partner, a trusted confidant, or a mental health professional to get the support you need.
Family dynamics have the potential to be one of the most challenging aspects of a relationship, but if you and your partner can communicate openly and honestly, you can establish healthy boundaries and navigate the role of family in a relationship with love and understanding.

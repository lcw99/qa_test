Why Stress Impacts Physical Health and How Partners Can Support Each Other
We often hear the phrase “stress is a killer.” Stress can weigh down our mental and emotional well-being and has a very real impact on our physical health. It is important for couples in a relationship to understand the link between stress and physical health and how they can support each other during times of high stress.
The Physical Impact of Stress
Stress can manifest itself in a variety of physical symptoms, such as headaches, chest pain, digestive issues, and difficulty breathing. Stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline can cause inflammation throughout the body, leading to an increased risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes. Stress can also weaken the immune system, leaving the body vulnerable to infection.
How Partners Can Help
Couples can support each other during times of stress by acknowledging and validating each other’s feelings. Being understanding and compassionate towards your partner’s emotions can help to reduce their stress levels and help to create a sense of safety between the two of you. Taking turns to take care of each other’s needs, whether it’s providing a shoulder to cry on, cooking a meal for one another, or just taking time to relax and be present together, can also be a great way to manage stress.
Engaging in stress-reducing activities together can also be beneficial. Exercise has been known to reduce stress and improve mood, so activities such as walking, biking, and yoga can be great ways to destress. Other calming activities such as meditation, listening to music, or engaging in an art project can also help to alleviate stress.
It’s important to remember that stress isn’t an individual problem, and couples can help to reduce each other’s stress levels by adopting a unified approach. By understanding the link between stress and physical health and being there for each other during times of stress, partners can create a mutually beneficial environment and improve their overall wellbeing.

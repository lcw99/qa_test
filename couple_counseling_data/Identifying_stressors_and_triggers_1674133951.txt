Coping with Stressors and Triggers Together as a Couple: A Guide to Better Communication and Stress Management
It’s no secret that relationships come with stress. Although it is impossible to avoid all stressors, it is possible to become better at managing them. One of the key steps couples can take in managing stress together is to identify and understand stressors and triggers in the relationship.  
Identifying Stressors and Triggers
The first step in better managing stress is to become aware of it. It’s important for couples to be able to identify their stressors and triggers in order to better respond to them. Identifying stressors and triggers can help couples be more effective in addressing them. Some stressors may be external, such as a family member’s death, a job change, or a new baby. Other stressors may be more internal, such as feeling unsatisfied with the relationship or having unrealistic expectations of one another. 
It can also be helpful to identify specific triggers that result in the couple feeling distressed. These triggers are often reactions to a particular stressor and can be both verbal and nonverbal cues. Examples of triggers can include criticism, sarcasm, ignoring one another, defensiveness, and being dismissive. When these triggers occur, they can lead to more intense distress in the relationship. 
Managing Stress Together
Now that you and your partner have identified stressors and triggers, it is time to move forward in better managing them. The most important thing to remember is that communication is key. When one of you feels stressed about something, it is important to discuss it with your partner and express your feelings. This allows you both to better understand and empathize with one another.
It is also important to develop coping strategies together. This could include trying to approach the situation from a problem-solving perspective or even taking a break from the situation to relax and refocus. Having a safe space to talk without judgement is another important factor in managing stress together. 
Finally, couples should focus on supporting one another during difficult times. One of the best ways to do this is to show love and appreciation for one another. This can be done through both verbal and nonverbal cues, such as hugs, compliments, and words of encouragement. 
Conclusion
Relationships come with stress and it is impossible to avoid it. However, couples can learn to better manage it by identifying and understanding stressors and triggers, communicating effectively, and supporting one another. With patience and practice, couples can learn to navigate the stress in their relationship and find a better balance.

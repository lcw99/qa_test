Title: Conflict Resolution in Relationships: Resolving Issues without Physicality
Having a healthy and communicative relationship is essential for couples, especially when it comes to resolving conflicts. Partners need to find constructive ways to express their disagreements and needs in order to keep the relationship healthy and growing. While it might be tempting to resort to physicality in the face of arguments, it is always best to find positive solutions to any disputes that come up between partners. 
The key to successful conflict resolution is communication, both verbal and non-verbal. Acknowledging and listening to each other's perspectives can help each person understand what the other is feeling, thus creating an opportunity for productive and positive solutions. Open dialogue is important to allow each person to express themselves and their emotions honestly and without fear of judgment. Remember to be respectful when discussing any disagreements, as this sets the tone for a healthier resolution. 
When it comes to the actual resolution of any conflict, the best bet is to develop a plan that both partners can agree on. This means finding a way to compromise and come to a mutually beneficial conclusion that allows each person to feel heard and respected. It is also important to remember to validate each otherâ€™s feelings, so that both partners feel understood and that their needs and wants are considered in the resolution process.
Finally, be sure to take some time apart after resolving any conflict. This allows both partners to calm down and reflect on what was discussed, and reinforces the idea that neither partner is to blame for any disagreements that may arise.
Conflict resolution is one of the cornerstones of a healthy and productive relationship. Couples should remember to communicate their needs openly and honestly and strive to find solutions that suit both parties, without resorting to physicality. This way, the couple can be sure to foster a respectful and understanding environment in their relationship.

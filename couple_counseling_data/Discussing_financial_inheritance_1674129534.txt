Discussing Financial Inheritance: How Couples Can Create a Mutual Financial Plan 
Inheriting money is a blessing and can help couples to achieve their financial goals faster and more securely. But discussing finances can be difficult and stressful. When it comes to inheritance, talking about money doesn’t always come easily. However, it is important to discuss the details of any financial inheritance and sort out how both individuals will handle the money so that it does not create conflict between them. 
It is important for couples to lay out their mutual financial goals before discussing inheritance. Knowing what you both want to accomplish financially and how you will manage your money going forward is key to establishing a financial plan that works for both of you. It is also important to talk about any insecurities or fears that you may have about your money, and how these may be addressed in the future. 
Once you have outlined your financial goals, you can begin to discuss any inheritance that either of you may receive. It is best to create an agreement in writing about how the money will be managed and any tax implications. This agreement should also include a plan for what will happen with the inheritance if the couple’s relationship should change in the future. 
When discussing inheritance, it is important to talk openly and honestly with each other in order to avoid misunderstandings. It is also important to set realistic expectations, as the money may not be immediately available. And while inheritance can be beneficial, it should not be put before the importance of saving and investing on your own.
By discussing financial inheritance openly and creating a financial plan, couples can ensure that they make the most of their inherited money without creating tension or discord in their relationship. With a mutual financial plan, couples can reach their financial goals and solidify their financial stability for the future.

The Value of Self-Care in Relationships: Making Time for Yourself
When two people enter into a relationship, it’s natural for them to want to prioritize their mutual needs and interests. But relationships should also include some level of self-care. This means making time to tend to your own needs and interests, separate from your partner. Taking time out for yourself is essential for maintaining your own emotional and physical wellbeing, and is just as important as your relationship with your partner.
The challenge is finding a balance between taking care of yourself and taking care of your relationship. This can be a tricky tightrope to walk, but with some practice and open dialogue between both partners, it is possible to make time for self-care while still building and nurturing a strong relationship. 
How to Establish Self-Care Habits in Relationships
When it comes to building self-care habits into your relationship, the most important thing is to start the conversation with your partner. Make sure you both understand why self-care is important and how beneficial it can be for both of you. It’s important to discuss each other’s individual needs and come up with a plan for how you can both meet them without compromising your relationship.
Once you’ve established your understanding of self-care, it’s time to practice. Here are a few ideas for how to prioritize self-care in your relationship: 
• Schedule time away – Carve out time each week that’s just for each of you, with no expectations or obligations. 
• Participate in activities you enjoy – Doing the things you enjoy can make you feel more connected to yourself, while still being part of the relationship. 
• Give each other space – Respect each other’s need for space, both physically and emotionally. 
• Practice self-care activities together – Doing self-care activities like exercising, meditating, or journaling together can bring you closer together while still allowing you to focus on your individual needs.
By taking the time to prioritize self-care, you can create a strong sense of connection and intimacy in your relationship. Open communication and mutual respect for each other’s needs is key to making it work. With practice and patience, both of you will be able to find the perfect balance between taking care of yourself and taking care of each other.

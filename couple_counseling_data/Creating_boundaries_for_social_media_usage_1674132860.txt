Creating Boundaries for Social Media Usage in Couple and Girlfriend/Boyfriend Relationships
By: 
The internet can be a powerful tool to connect people in ways that were not possible before. However, it can also be very intrusive and cross boundaries in ways that can damage relationships and cause avoidable arguments and tension. Establishing healthy boundaries regarding social media usage in a couple or girlfriend/boyfriend relationship is essential in order to protect the privacy of both parties and maintain the trust in the relationship.
First and foremost, it’s important to have an honest and open conversation about your boundaries for social media usage. While it’s fine to follow each other on social media, it’s important to set boundaries as to what is and what is not acceptable behavior. For example, do you want your partner to be able to view all of your posts and “like” them, or would you prefer that they not interact with your account? It’s important to discuss these preferences to avoid any misunderstanding or hurt feelings.
Another important boundary for social media usage is setting a limit to how often you will check each other’s accounts. Constantly checking each other’s accounts can lead to increased jealousy and unnecessary arguments. It’s important to remember that social media accounts are not a representation of reality, and it’s important to give each other space and not just rely on social media for your interactions.
When it comes to activities such as “checking-in” on social media, it’s important to agree upon a policy. Generally speaking, it’s not a good idea for one partner to constantly keep tabs on the other’s whereabouts. If a policy is agreed upon, it’s important to stick to it and not try to overstep into each other’s business.
Finally, it’s important to remember that social media can be a great way to interact, but it should not be the primary way to interact or keep in touch with your partner. In-person conversations and interactions should be the focus of the relationship, not endless scrolling on social media.
Though it can be difficult to set and stick to boundaries regarding social media usage, it can save couples and girlfriend/boyfriend relationships from unnecessary arguments and hurt feelings. By setting boundaries and having honest conversations, couples and girlfriend/boyfriends can create a safe and healthy space for their relationship.

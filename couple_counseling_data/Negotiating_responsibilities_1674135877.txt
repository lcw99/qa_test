Setting Boundaries and Negotiating Responsibilities in a Couple Relationship 
When entering into a relationship, two people bring in different expectations, beliefs, and values that can shape the partnership. Acknowledging each partner’s individual perspectives is an important step before attempting to negotiate and agree upon a shared set of priorities.
It is important for partners to understand that whatever is negotiated is not about who is right and who is wrong, but rather creating a cohesive life together. This can improve communication, understanding, and ultimately, trust.
When attempting to negotiate responsibilities within a relationship, it is important to begin by listening. This sets a foundation of open communication and mutual respect. Once partners have expressed their respective wants, needs, and expectations, it is important to focus on finding a compromise. Focusing on the ‘we’ instead of the ‘me’ means that decisions are made based on both partners’ interests, not just one's own.
Setting boundaries is another essential factor when negotiating responsibilities. This includes setting limits and expectations for yourself and communicating them to your partner. This can help make sure that both partners feel supported and respected.
Identifying and prioritizing shared goals and values is the key to any successful relationship. To do this, partners must be willing to make an effort to understand one another. Open communication and compromise are essential to ensure that both parties are satisfied, respected, and heard. When both partners consider the needs of their partner as well as their own, it is more likely that the relationship will be stronger in the long run.

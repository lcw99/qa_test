Title: Negative Thought Patterns: Identifying and Altering Habitual Thinking in Stressful Times 
When it comes to managing stress in couples and relationships, identifying and changing negative thought patterns can be an effective tool. Unhelpful and self-defeating thoughts and beliefs can worsen feelings of anxiety and fear, leaving partners feeling overwhelmed and helpless. It is important for couples to recognize when these patterns are present in order to effectively mitigate their effects on the relationship.
What are Negative Thought Patterns?
A negative thought pattern is an habitual, often automatic, thought about a situation or person that can be largely unhelpful, self-limiting, and create feelings of distress. Negative thoughts can often be characterized by self-labeling, magnifying and minimizing, and blaming. Oftentimes, these self-defeating thoughts are based on assumptions or previous experiences, and may not be grounded in reality. It is important to recognize these patterns in order to be able to manage them.
Identifying Negative Thought Patterns
The first step in learning to manage negative thought patterns is to recognize when they are occurring. It is important to pay attention to the thoughts and feelings that arise when faced with a challenging situation or person. Another way to identify these thought patterns is to become aware of the language and words that are used to describe the situation or person. Self-labeling, for example, often includes words such as “useless,” “stupid,” or “weak.” Magnifying and minimizing can include statements such as “this is the worst thing ever” or “this doesn't matter.” Blaming can take the form of “it’s her fault” or “he’s to blame.” Becoming aware of these self-defeating thoughts can help to identify and manage them more effectively.
Changing Negative Thought Patterns
The next step in managing negative thought patterns is to identify ways to alter them. One way to do this is to ask oneself questions that can help to reframe the thought and focus on more helpful and productive possibilities. For example, in the case of self-labeling, one might ask themselves, “What evidence do I have to support this thought?” or “What are other ways I could look at this situation?” Similarly, with magnifying and minimizing, one can ask themselves “What is the evidence to support this thought?” or “What might be the value in looking at this from a different perspective?” Lastly, in the case of blaming, one might ask themselves, “What might be the cause of this situation?” or “What could I do to help this situation?” 
In addition to these questions, it may also be helpful to practice self-compassion and supportive self-talk. Instead of focusing on the negative thought pattern, focus on self-care activities, positive affirmations, and understanding one’s feelings and needs.
By recognizing and managing negative thought patterns in stressful times, couples can learn to better support each other, build trust, and ultimately strengthen their relationships.

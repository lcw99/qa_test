Setting Individual and Joint Goals in a Relationship â€“ Steps for Achieving Lasting Success
Setting goals in a relationship is an important part of keeping it successful and healthy. Goals provide direction, progress and motivation, giving both partners something to work towards. However, making sure that goals are both achievable and accepted by both partners can often be a difficult task. To ensure that this process runs smoothly, it is important to take the time to identify both individual and shared goals.
Identifying Individual Goals
Every individual has their own hopes and dreams, even when in a relationship. It is important to take the time to discuss these with your partner, and to ensure that they are given due consideration. It is not only important that they are heard, but it is also important to make sure that personal goals are achievable in the context of both individual and shared life plans. Once expressed, try to find a way in which personal goals contribute to the overall shared vision for the relationship. It is important to be realistic about goals, discussing how much time and energy can be devoted to each of them.
Identifying Shared Goals
Once individual goals have been identified, it is important to find common ground between them. This can be difficult, as both partners may have different aspirations and ambitions. However, it is important to remember that the shared goals must benefit both parties. This could mean setting goals that reflect both members of the relationship, or setting a goal which both parties have a vested interest in. It is also important to ensure that these shared goals are communicated effectively so that each party is aware of their importance and responsibilities.
Working Towards Goals
Once individual and joint goals have been identified and agreed upon, it is time to work towards them. It is important to remember that progress towards goals is likely to be slow and that it is likely to fluctuate along the way. It is important to maintain motivation and to stay on track, so it is important to have regular discussions about progress, challenges, and successes. It is also important to keep track of how the goals are being achieved and to make sure that both partners are satisfied with the results.
By taking the time to identify both individual and shared goals, and by regularly checking in on progress, it is possible to set and work towards goals in a relationship that are both achievable and rewarding. This process can be a great way of strengthening the relationship and ensuring that both partners are on the same page.

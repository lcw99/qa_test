  Subtitle: How to Use Self Awareness and Self Control to Resolve Issues
Couples and those in relationships rely on problem-solving skills to navigate issues that come up along the way. One of the best tools to employ in problem solving is emotional intelligence, or “EQ”. Self awareness, self regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills are all elements of emotional intelligence that are beneficial to improving communication and problem-solving between couples.
Self awareness is the ability to understand your own emotional state, what triggers it, and how it impacts your behavior. To employ emotional intelligence for problem solving, each partner must first recognize and accept their own emotional reactions, such as anger or frustration.
Self control is the ability to manage and express emotions appropriately and with consideration of others. To use emotional intelligence, couples must learn to manage their own emotions and responses to difficult problems. They must be able to take a step back and think through the issue with a level head and a clear perspective.
Motivation is the capacity to take action and keep going despite obstacles in the way. Couples who understand and use emotional intelligence understand the importance of being motivated to work towards a resolution and a better outcome for the relationship.
Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. To effectively use emotional intelligence to problem-solve, couples must be empathetic to one another and try to see things from their partner's perspective.
Social skills are the capacity to interact and communicate effectively with others. Good communication is a key factor in problem solving, and couples must practice listening, understanding, and finding the right words to express their feelings and perspectives.
Emotional intelligence is a helpful and important tool for couples to use in problem-solving. With self awareness, self control, motivation, empathy, and social skills, couples can learn to understand and address each other's feelings and needs, as well as find mutually beneficial solutions.

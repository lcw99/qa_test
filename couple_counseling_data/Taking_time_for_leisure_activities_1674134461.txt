Take a Break: How Leisure Activities Help Couples Manage Stress 
Stress can be a challenge for any couple, especially during difficult times. When life gets tough and it feels like there’s no way out, it can be easy to forget to take care of ourselves and each other. Fortunately, taking time for leisure activities can be a great way to manage stress and stay connected. 
Leisure activities can help couples destress by providing an outlet to express emotions, connect with each other, and be creative. Making time to take a break from stressful situations can help both partners to refocus, regroup, and better manage stress. Even something as simple as going for a walk together or playing a game can be beneficial. 
Couples can also use leisure activities to bond, trying something new together or engaging in activities they both enjoy. Activities that involve physical movement such as hikes or dancing can be especially beneficial. Doing activities that one partner likes and the other partner doesn't can also help to bring partners closer together, showing understanding and support for each other.
When it comes to stress management, it’s important to remember that leisure activities don’t have to require a lot of time or money. Whether it’s taking a break to watch a movie together, going on a day trip, or simply playing a few rounds of cards, there are plenty of opportunities to take time for leisure activities. Connecting with one another, actively listening, and voicing appreciation and understanding can help couples better manage stress in difficult times.

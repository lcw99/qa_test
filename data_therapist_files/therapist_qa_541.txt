I think you have identified something important here. It's not unusual to experience feelings that don't seem to match up with what your rational mind recognizes.Â In this case, it sounds like a part of you recognizes that the people around you do not find you "annoying and bothersome." Despite knowing that people like you, it seems that there's still a part of you that feels like you're a bother.Finding a local counselor who can work with you to process those feelings might be just the help you need.

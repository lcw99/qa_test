I am very sorry to hear that you are going through this!
While animals can be a wonderful way to experience emotional support, you may
want to consider opening up to a Life Coach or therapist to discuss some of
your concerns. You are not alone, and many people are experiencing very similar
anxieties. A Life Coach or professional therapist could help to guide you
through these emotions and refer you to additional professional help if needed.
It sounds as though you want to address some of these issues by first asking
the question. Finding additional support from a trained professional whom you
feel comfortable with could be the best way to get the help that you need. I
wish you the best of luck on your journey!

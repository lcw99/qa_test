Hi...let's start with what's causing you to sneak out of the house?Understanding the motivation behind your actions (in this case...your sneaking out at night) can often times help you create the change you want.  Are you arguing with your parents? Do you feel misunderstood? Alone? Scared? Stressed out? What are you doing once you leave the house? Where are you going? Are people in your home in conflict? Do you feel safer when you leave? Most importantly, reflect on what may be behind the reason for your wanting to leave the house and feeling not in control of your actions?  Talk to someone about what's going on, because maybe that person could help you create the movement you are seeking.

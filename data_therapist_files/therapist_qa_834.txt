There is no wrong or right way to define a relationship. I believe each relationship we are in is an opportunity to expand and to know self on a deeper level. We are conditioned to believe that we are not valued, or worth much without the confirmation of others and the world around us.Â Give yourself time and try to not go to those who are toxic and enjoy the drama of others lives as s way to avoid looking at themselves.

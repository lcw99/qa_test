Would you worry less if you and your partner had a plan as to when you will be together as a couple?Long distance relationships are not for everybody. Â  Some people need the daily or frequent interaction to feel secure.The question is not so much how to deal with anxiety that your partner is cheating on you than whether your own emotional and relationship requirements are satisfied with a long distance relationship.Anyway, cheating has nothing to do with distance since married people cheat while living together for years under the same roof!

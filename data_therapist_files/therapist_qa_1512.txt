It is not the case of being right or wrong, in my view. If you are asking, I believe you trulyÂ care for your boyfriend. It seems like he is having difficulties in establishing trust in this relationship. The ideal would be to come closer to his upsetness and to show him that you are there for him. I hope all goes well. Rossana Mag.

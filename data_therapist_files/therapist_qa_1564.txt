Well, if you each want to be with the other, than no one will be lost.Have you told her about feeling slighted?  Start telling her about your feelings.  How she responds to you will tell you a lot about where her heart is and maybe too some of the reasons she has been so involved w the friend.Who knows, maybe the friend has problems of her own and your gf is spending extra time w the friend to help the friend, and doesn't even know you feel hurt.You would do yourself and your gf a lot of good to tell more about your feelings.  Either you will get more closeness and consideration, or not.  At least you will have the truth.

It's absolutely normal.  Therapy provides a space where you can be free to express yourself and experience all of your emotions fully.  Crying is a form of release, and many people feel like they do not have any other space where they can let out their emotions.  Crying can be a healthy way to be present with your emotions.  While not everyone will cry during a therapy session, you're not the first, and definitely not the last.

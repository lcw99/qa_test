Do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to it?Are you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him better?Basically, first know your own reason for your question.   Then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you.  In the best of cases, he doesn't realize how his actions affect you and he will change.

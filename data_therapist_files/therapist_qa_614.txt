It sounds like your children are walking on eggshells, and behaving in a manner that suggests that (at minimum) they may be receiving an undue amount of anger from someone in their lives. In addition to addressing this delicately with your children's father, it would be wise to speak with your children's teachers and pediatrician as well. Please closelyÂ  monitor the situation, and express to your children that they can always come to you with any information, and they will never be in trouble for confiding in you.

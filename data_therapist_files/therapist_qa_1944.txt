I love to see tears! There's an old saying, "The eyes are the windows to the soul." External emotions are a pretty good indicator of what's going on inside the person, and if tears are present, that often means the person is processing (i.e., moving forward) through their emotions! I'm more concerned when I don't see tears from my clients because that can mean the client is "stuck." So, don't feel bad for crying! You are moving through your emotions to a place of healing!

I've talked to many teens who frequently sneak out. The question I always ask them is, "What are you getting from sneaking out that you aren't getting at home?" Many teens answer they are hooking up, using substances, and engaging in other risky behaviors. As uncomfortable as it might be, I encourage you to talk with your parents or guardians about the reasons why you are sneaking out. What are you getting "out there" that you aren't getting at home? A good family counselor can help sort through those issues. Good luck!

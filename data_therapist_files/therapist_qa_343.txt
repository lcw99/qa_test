Good questions! The paradox of thinking about forever is that you can become more motivated to live only in the present. Thinking about forever can certainly be overwhelming, it's a lot to think about, What can you do about your future? Be present - learn and relax, knowing that you are doing everything you can right here, right now. There is a book by Eckhart Tolle - The Power of Now - that you might be interested in. Enjoy your journey!

Congrats on having a happiness problem.Go slowly and tell your partner how you feel as you discover how being loved feels.On a deep level youâ€™re releasing yourself from interaction patterns which treated you poorly and unkindly.Time is needed of repeated occurrences of this newfound loving behavior toward you.Gradually you will trust more and more that your new living relationship life is your reality.

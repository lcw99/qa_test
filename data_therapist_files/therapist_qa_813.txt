The decision to end a relationship is difficult. There are a few questions you might want to ask yourself like, "Why am I asking myself if i should end it?", "What else am I looking for in a relationship that this one doesn't give me?", "is my boyfriend willing to discuss my doubts and willing to work at making this relationship better?", "Is he abusive in any way?" These are just a few questionsto think through in order to make this decision. Also talk to a trusted friend and see they're point of view of your relationship. Sometimes talking it over can help you think out loud and you're friend can point out details you can't thought about. Talking to a therapist is also a good option as a therapist can hello you figure out what you are looking for and address any issues that need to be addressed.

Why do you blame other people who had nothing to do with your actions?If it is because after the fact you wish you had accepted their help, then the person who is responsible for this is you!Since you are aware of your tendencies and how the interfere with your life, try to become aware of when you do these habits.This way you can interrupt your own patterns a little bit at a time.

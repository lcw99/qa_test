Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain.  I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically.  Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist.  Seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms.    After getting these evaluations, your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing.  Whether treatment includes medication and/or psychotherapist would be discussed.  Please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up.

Why not make good use of your unexpected attraction to study the features you consider attractive in someone.Attraction based on physicality is normal. Â As long as you have no negative thoughts of doing harm to the person or yourself which are connected to the attraction you feel, and so long as your attraction isn't stopping you from doing your daily life responsibilities such as work, to take care of your daily needs and any responsibilities you have for other people, then eventually it will lose its power on you.

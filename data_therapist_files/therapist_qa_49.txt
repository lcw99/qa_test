There are never too many issues in living. In a way we take on too many issues at one time. Then we become over whelmed with "anxiety and depression."Â  A skillful, caring therapist will help you find a place to start and deal with one issue at a time. when this helps the other issues. Then the other issues become more manageable. I gain. confidence I can take on life better and, importantly , enjoy living life more. My best to you. Dr. Spencer

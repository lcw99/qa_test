When you have the right therapist you just know, as evidence of the help that you have received, the progress that you have made, Â from the rapport and partnership that you have gained with your therapist, and from if you feel supported in a way that is helpful to you, as well as if your therapist has a good understanding of what your needs are and what you desire to gain from your therapy experience.
